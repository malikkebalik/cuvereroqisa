How thin? One report says less than 170 pounds.</p><p>Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer <a href=#>reported Wednesday</a> that, per sources, Smith measured 6-foot-0.2 and weighed 166 pounds during an in-person NFL medical testing combine in Indianapolis late last month. An NFL source confirmed those numbers to The Athletic’s Stephen Holder.</p><p>Smith was <a href=#>reluctant to share his weight</a> at Alabama’s pro day on March 23 before eventually telling reporters he weighed 170 pounds. The school had listed the Heisman Trophy winner at 6-foot-1, 175 pounds.</p><p>In 2019, Oklahoma’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Marquise Brown</a> became the first wide receiver of the 2000s to be drafted in the first round at less than 170 pounds, taken by the Ravens at No. 25. Brown weighed in at 166. He ended his rookie season at 157 before bulking up to 180 for Year 2.</p><p>Is Smith’s weight situation really that big a deal, though?</p><p>“Does Smith’s weight matter? Sure,” said The Athletic’s Dane Brugler, who ranked Smith at No. 9 on his <a href=#>latest big board</a> published Wednesday. “But I think it’s a tad overstated because it isn’t a surprise. Last spring, scouts weighed him at 172 and then he was in the 160s before the season. Scouts weighed him at the Alabama pro day in March and he was 170 pounds. Then 4 pounds lighter at his medical evaluation.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“His playing weight is likely somewhere in the 165-172 range, which obviously isn’t ideal and some teams will not draft an outlier like that in the first round. But it doesn’t change what he put on tape and there will be several other teams eager to draft that type of talent in the first round.”</p><p>Smith’s tape at Alabama always speaks for itself. The only wide receiver in the history of the SEC to record multiple games of four or more touchdown catches, Smith did anything he wanted in college. In his last two seasons, he had 3,115 receiving yards and 37 touchdowns on 184 receptions. Per Pro Football Focus, Smith led the country in deep yards and catches (15 for 589) and screen yards (35 for 304). He was a force in the slot, out wide as an X.</p><p>And he was all those things as a thin football player.</p><h3><strong>April 14: <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Justin Fields</a> takes aim at a top-three slot … again</strong></h3><p>Following the strategy of Alabama QB <a href=#>Mac Jones</a>, who held two pro-day throwing sessions last month, Ohio State’s <a href=#>Justin Fields</a> took to the field Wednesday for his second pre-draft workout. Unlike Jones, whose showcase was broadcast on multiple networks with 31 of 32 NFL teams in attendance (the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Rams</a> <a href=#>being the exception</a>), Fields’ encore took place behind closed doors — no media and a limited guest list.</p><p>Teams in attendance, <a href=#>per the NFL Network’s Albert Breer</a>: the Jets, San Francisco, Atlanta, Carolina, Detroit, Denver and New England. A <a href=#>tweet from Ohio State</a> also showed <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Bears</a> coach Matt Nagy at the workout. The Athletic’s Matt Barrows <a href=#>reported</a> earlier this week that the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>49ers</a> provided “input on the types of throws Fields” attempted, thanks to head coach Kyle Shanahan’s close relationship with Fields’ personal QBs coach, John Beck. (Beck was Washington’s backup QB from 2010-11, with Shanahan as his offensive coordinator.)</p><p>What we do have of Fields’ latest pro day comes courtesy of Ohio State’s Instagram feed:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here’s video from Justin Fields’ workout today courtesy Ohio State. Kyle Shanahan, John Lynch and 49ers QB coach Rich Scangarello were among the NFL personnel on hand. SF had some input in Fields’ throw selection, but it’s unclear if any of those throws are on tape: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LCTZuWWFGb</a></p><p>— David Lombardi (@LombardiHimself) <a href=#>April 14, 2021</a></p><p>There are a couple of “wow” throws in there, including that off-balance, 65-yard bomb to the end zone at about the 10-second mark. Perhaps even more important than the on-field outing, though, Ohio State’s additional pro day gave Fields another chance to put in some face time with the teams likely to be interested in him come April 29.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Consensus has the Jets, at No. 2 overall, zeroed in on <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Zach Wilson</a>, but the other teams in Columbus on Wednesday fall between picks 3 (San Francisco) and 15 (New England). Did Fields sway any minds, one way or the other? Did the GMs in attendance talk about a deal, should Fields make his way to Atlanta’s spot at 4 or Detroit’s at 7?</p><p>Fields wasn’t the only Buckeye who participated Wednesday, either. Joining him was cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Shaun Wade</a> (No. 23 at his position with a fifth-round grade in <a href=#>Dane Brugler’s draft guide</a>), who sat out Ohio State’s March pro day to rehab a turf-toe issue.</p><p>His agent, Michael Perrett, had these numbers for Wade’s workout:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shaun Wade – Ohio State</p><p>Pro Day #’s</p><p>40 – 4.43<br>Vert – 37.5<br>Broad – 10’ 3”</p><p>👀 💨</p><p>Nice work <a href=#>@shaunwade24</a>!</p><p>— Michael Perrett (@PerrettM) <a href=#>April 14, 2021</a></p><h3><strong>April 8: Medical rechecks set for Indianapolis</strong></h3><p>This is not technically a pro day, but the latest example of how NFL teams (and agents) are scrambling ahead of this year’s draft:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nearly 150 NFL Draft prospects are currently in Indy for in-person medical exams and physicals for what is usually Combine re-checks. Half the group has scans today, full exams tomorrow. The other half has scans tomorrow, exams Saturday. Mostly top 3 rounds, plus medical risks.</p><p>— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) <a href=#>April 8, 2021</a></p><p>Normally, around this time, a small group of prospects would be headed back to Indianapolis for their second round of medical checks — the first having taken place during the combine, for all 330-some players invited. This year, of course, there was no scouting combine so the league has tried to bridge the gap with local and virtual medical visits. But this is the only time a huge crop of players will be in at the same time, with the same doctors.</p><p>Ian Rapoport added that presumptive No. 1 pick <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Trevor Lawrence</a>, who recently had surgery on a torn labrum in his left (non-throwing shoulder), will miss this slate of check-ups because he’s getting married this weekend. Potential first-round offensive lineman <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Liam Eichenberg</a> (Notre Dame) also won’t travel after testing positive for COVID-19 — he could be brought to Indianapolis at a later, pre-draft date, per Rapoport.</p><p>The league has not released a full list of those who are scheduled to be in attendance. Potentially on the list, though, are Alabama receivers DeVonta Smith (thumb) and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jaylen Waddle</a> (ankle), each of whom played through injuries last season; and Virginia Tech corner <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Caleb Farley</a>, who had surgery just a couple of weeks ago.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>It also could be a key few hours for some of the high-profile 2020 opt-outs, like <a class=ath_autolink href=#>LSU WR Ja’Marr Chase</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Oregon OT Penei Sewell</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Northwestern OT Rashawn Slater</a>. NFL teams already have put eyes on those players at their respective pro days, and in virtual interviews, but it’s been a long time since any of them actually suited up for a game.</p><p>We should hear by the weekend if any prospect ran into any issues during these Indianapolis trips. You might recall that last year’s rechecks were vital to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tua Tagovailoa</a>, as he received very positive feedback in his recovery from a hip injury.</p><h3><strong>April 7: Texas Tech opens the final week of pro days</strong></h3><p>We’re at the end of the line here (no surprise, as the draft is three weeks away): Texas Tech’s draft hopefuls hit the field Wednesday; Ball State, Houston, Rice and UAB are scheduled to host the last set of pro days Friday.</p><p>The highest-rated Texas Tech prospect this year, according to Dane Brugler’s <a href=#>remarkable draft guide</a> (“The Beast”): cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Zech McPhearson</a>, who put together a strong outing with a 4.48-second 40, 40.5-inch vertical, 130-inch broad jump and 6.84 three-cone. Dane has McPhearson with a fourth-round grade as the No. 16 cornerback: “Overall, McPhearson has an intriguing mix of fluidity, toughness and cover skills and with improved play recognition, he should compete for NFL starting reps, fitting both man and zone teams with inside/outside ability.”</p><p>Another Red Raider who should attract draft interest is offensive lineman <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jack Anderson</a>, a Senior Bowl participant. He carries a Round 7 grade in The Beast. The 6-foot-6, 309-pound guard/center option put up 27 reps on the bench press.</p><h3>April 2: Oregon OT <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Penei Sewell</a> shows off explosion, power</h3><p>Oregon offensive tackle Penei Sewell, one of the top players in this class regardless of position, showed explosion and power Friday during his pro day. And some pretty crazy numbers for a player his size.</p><p>Sewell, a 20-year-old offensive tackle who won the Outland Trophy and earned unanimous All-American honors as an 18-year-old sophomore, measured in at 6-4, 331 pounds with 10 3/8-inch hands, 33 1/4-inch arms and an 80 7/8-inch wingspan (numbers per Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy). Sewell’s arm length will show up on the short side, but his measurement was basically the same as that of nine-time Pro Bowler <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jason Peters</a>. That number didn’t matter for Peters, and it’s not likely to matter for Sewell either because of everything else he brings to the table.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Sewell’s broad jump of nine feet, one inch shows rare explosion for a player his size. Kent Lee Platte, creator of the popular Relative Athletic Score metric, noted Sewell is one of just 22 players in his database (which includes more than 20,000 prospects) to jump 9-1 or better at 330 pounds or higher. Peters and current Rams star <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Andrew Whitworth</a> are two other rare examples. Sewell recorded a 28-inch vertical leap, did 30 bench-press reps of 225 and ran an official 40-yard dash time of 5.09, per Nagy. Sewell also, per NFL Network, turned in a three-cone time of 7.8 seconds.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>There aren't a lot of 330 pound players who jumped 9'1" or better.</p><p>In fact, of the more than 20k players in my DB, that only describes 22 players, 15 of which are OT, including Penei Sewell.</p><p>Includes Andrew Whitworth (334 lbs, 904 broad) and Jason Peters (336 lbs, 907 broad).</p><p>— Kent Lee Platte (@MathBomb) <a href=#>April 2, 2021</a></p><p>Northwestern OT <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Rashawn Slater</a> posted better numbers in the 40, both jumps and the three-cone, but he is also 30 pounds lighter and two years older than Sewell, who turns 21 in October. Both prospects, widely considered the top two tackles in this draft, are also among the strongest players overall.</p><p>The Athletic’s Dane Brugler rates Sewell as the No. 5-ranked player in the class, and the top offensive tackle (ahead of Slater at No. 11 overall).</p><p>Oregon safety <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jevon Holland</a> (No. 61 on Brugler’s board) measured in at 6-foot, 207 pounds and ran a 4.45-second 40-yard dash. Holland also reportedly recorded a 35 1/2-inch vertical leap and a 10-foot, six-inch broad jump.</p><h3><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Zaven Collins</a> stays on track to be a top-50 selection</h3><p>Zaven Collins isn’t built — and doesn’t play — like the other projected top linebackers in this class. The 6-foot-4, 259-pound Tulsa product offers, as draft expert Dane Brugler put it, “the size of a defensive end and the athleticism of a safety.”</p><p>Case in point: some of Collins’ numbers from his Friday pro day. A 4.67-second 40-yard dash likely won’t wow a lot of folks, but it’s similar to what bigger (and very successful) linebackers like <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dont’a Hightower</a> (4.68) and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Anthony Barr</a> (4.66) ran in the past. Collins added to it with a 35-inch vertical and better than 10-foot broad jump. His three-cone — once it becomes official — will be a big part of the evaluation, too.</p><p>All in all, though, Collins likely did little to scare off any teams interested in him as a hybrid edge.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>As with everyone else in this class aside from Trevor Lawrence, the question now becomes: How early will a team need to pounce? There are apparent fits for Collins in late Round 1, with teams like Pittsburgh and New Orleans. And, once the draft ticks into Round 2, Collins could stand out as a value for those non-playoff teams picking early on Day 2.</p><h3>April 1: After difficult 2020, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Rashod Bateman</a> reminds everyone of his upside</h3><p>Minnesota receiver Rashod Bateman is a prime example of why evaluating the 2020 college season is a challenge for NFL teams. Bateman initially opted out of the year after contracting COVID-19 over the summer — he has a history of asthma. He then rejoined the Gophers for the Big Ten’s delayed start, caught 36 balls over five games … then opted out again after Minnesota went on a COVID pause midseason.</p><p>So, his 2019 tape might be more worthwhile in the scouting process. Playing at 198 pounds then, Bateman racked up 1,219 yards and 11 touchdowns with a 20.3 yards-per-catch average. This past season, following his illness, he struggled to get back up to 190 pounds.</p><p>That’s where he weighed in (at 190) for his pro day. He told Pro Football Focus, though, that he’d like to be at his previous, heavier weight. “That’s what I was comfortable at in 2019,” Bateman said. “Gonna work on getting back in that area.”</p><p>He’ll have a lot less control over his height — Bateman was just above 6-0 Thursday, while Minnesota had him listed at 6-2. Either way, he has shown what a dangerous playmaker he can be, and he backed up that reputation with an unofficial 4.39-second 40 and 36-inch vertical. The former, especially, is a big-time number for Bateman, who’s not necessarily known as a burner.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rashod Bateman with the 4.39u 40-yard dash 👀<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hqstqmnHjI</a></p><p>— PFF (@PFF) <a href=#>April 1, 2021</a></p><p>Time will tell if Bateman did enough, both during his college career and at his pro-day workout, to break through the potential logjam of receivers in late Round 1/early Round 2. He could be right there with LSU’s Terrace Marshall among the likeliest options to sneak into the top 25.</p><h3>Oklahoma State’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Teven Jenkins</a> big, strong — and fast!</h3><p>Oklahoma State tackle Teven Jenkins showed off power and speed at his pro day Thursday. The 6-foot-6, 310-pound tackle — who played both left and right in college — put up 36 bench reps of 225 pounds, which would’ve landed him third at last year’s combine.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Jenkins also reportedly ran a 4.9-second 40-yard dash, an outstanding time for a powerful tackle his size. A punishing run blocker in college with enough quickness to be effective in gap and zone, Jenkins probably translates best to a right tackle at the next level. He’s a people-mover all the way, but his run Thursday surely gave scouts something else to think about.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Teven Jenkins runs a 4.9 40 time. <a href=#>#OkState</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3rDrksjCKY</a></p><p>— Ryan Novozinsky (@ryannovo62) <a href=#>April 1, 2021</a></p><p>The Athletic’s Dane Brugler currently rates Jenkins as the <a href=#>No. 20 overall player in this class</a> (OT4). Oklahoma State receiver <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tylan Wallace</a> reportedly ran a 4.43 40, while teammate <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Chuba Hubbard</a> turned in an unofficial 4.36 run.</p><p>Elsewhere, Central Florida safety <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Richie Grant</a> developed a reputation in college as a safety who could play pretty much anywhere on the back end with efficiency. On Thursday, Grant measured in at 5-11, 197 pounds with a 77-inch wingspan and a 34 1/2-inch vertical jump. He also recorded a broad jump of 10 feet, nine inches.</p><p>Grant, a two-star recruit out of high school, is not known for his foot speed, though he did log a 4.53 40. His frame isn’t overwhelming either. However, his football IQ at UCF was outstanding. He was great in the box against the run, he was a willing and effective tackler and a steady hand in coverage both in the slot, the box and back deep. Athletic testing will be notable, but Grant’s stock is where it is (Brugler rates him No. 37 on his big board) because of his feel for the game.</p><p>Grant’s secondary teammate at UCF, cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Aaron Robinson</a>, reportedly turned in an impressive 4.38 40. Robinson is also in Brugler’s top 100.</p><h3>March 31: Ja’Marr Chase paces a big day for LSU’s draft hopefuls</h3><p>Well, where shall we start with LSU’s talent-loaded pro day? It probably makes the most sense to open at the top: wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase. With or without Wednesday’s showing, Chase figured to be one of the first — maybe the first — non-QB off the board come April 29. But these numbers will only help his cause:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The debate is over.

As you might have noticed during the ongoing pro-day circuit, 40 times (and most testing numbers) are pretty much up across the board, so any shaky results from Chase might have opened the door for DeVonta Smith or Jaylen Waddle to leapfrog him in the receiver rankings. Chase still might not be WR1 for all 32 teams, but he has a case to be.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Fellow WR Terrace Marshall — who stepped into an expanded role when Chase opted out of the 2020 season — also clocked in at 4.38, with a 38-inch vertical. Those playoff teams picking late in Round 1 and looking for a weapon to help them over the top might land on Marshall, who is coming off off a 48-catch, 10-touchdown performance during the abbreviated 2020 season.</p><p>The fastest LSU receiver Wednesday, however, was the 6-2, 217-pound <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Racey McMath</a>, who ran a 4.34. Slot corner <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kary Vincent</a> (5-9, 185) even one-upped that at 4.33.</p><p>At the opposite end of the speed spectrum was 350-pound defensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tyler Shelvin</a>.

He can play on the line, he can split out as a flex TE, work as an X receiver. Whatever. If he’s matched up in man coverage with a linebacker or a safety, it’ll likely be problematic.

Not every Jones deep ball was that accurate — he overthrew a handful of balls (and clipped a net hanging off the Alabama practice facility ceiling on one, which was just bad luck).</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>But, as Jones told the SEC Network after, a goal at pro day No. 2 was to let the army of NFL coaches, GMs and talent evaluators on hand see him turn it loose a bit.</p><p>“At the end of the day, hopefully I did show my arm strength,” Jones said. “I can throw it 65 (yards) or however long I need to throw it, but in a real game, it’s all about being a passer and not a thrower. …&nbsp; I already did one pro day and it was fun, so (I wanted to) come out here and sling it deep a little bit and let those guys catch some throws.”</p><p>Also tucked into Jones’ lengthy script Tuesday were a couple of bootleg throws that looked similar to Zach Wilson’s highlight-reel moment from his pro day. Jones said he had “be creative” written on the play sheet, to “show I can do subtle movements” in and out of the pocket.</p><p>Among those in attendance Tuesday were 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch, who now own the No. 3 pick in the draft, as well as <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Saints</a> coach Sean Payton, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Patriots</a> coach Bill Belichick (and his offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels) and several other general managers.</p><p>They were treated to something of a surprise cameo from Smith, who wasn’t expected to go through on-field drills because of an injured finger he suffered during the national-title game. Smith did not work out during Alabama’s initial pro day.</p><p>Jones, however, helped talk Smith into running some routes. He caught several passes, including the deep shot above and a leaping, red-zone fade. (Smith dropped the first fade as he tried to make a twisting grab, but secured the second.)</p><p>“My hand feels good, it doesn’t bother me at all,” Smith told the SEC Network. “The competitiveness came out in me. I was starting to get a little too carried away, but it felt good to be out there.”</p><p>Running back — and first-round hopeful — Najee Harris also took part Tuesday, after just observing the first time as he works to rehab an ankle injury.

Phillips, per Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy, ran a 4.56 40-yard dash while also recording a 36-inch vertical leap and 21 reps on the bench. He also recorded a 10-foot, five-inch broad jump.</p><p>Phillips, a former five-star recruit who medically retired from football after two rough years at UCLA (with an ankle injury and a severe wrist injury from a moped accident), only played one year at Miami, but it was a good one. In 2020, Phillips racked up 45 tackles (15.5 TFL) with eight sacks, an interception and three pass breakups. Phillips rates No. 25 on Dane Brugler’s most recent top 100 big board.</p><p>Fellow Canes edge rusher Gregory Rousseau (No. 34 on Brugler’s board) measured in at 6-foot-6, 266 pounds with 11-inch hands and an 83 1/4-inch wingspan (34 1/4-inch arms). Rousseau — who opted out last season but had 15.5 sacks in 2019 — ran a 4.71 40 (per Nagy) with a 30-inch vert and 21 bench reps. Rousseau’s broad jump was nine feet seven inches.</p><p>On the offensive side of the ball, Miami tight end <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Brevin Jordan</a> (6-foot-2 1/2, 247 pounds) ran a 4.69-second 40 with a 31-inch vertical jump and 17 bench reps. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Quincy Roche</a>, another Miami edge prospect, ran a 4.68 40 with a 32 1/2-inch vertical jump and 23 bench reps.</p><h3>How many North Carolina prospects will land in the early rounds?</h3><p>A lot of the attention paid to ACC football last season (understandably) focused on Clemson and Notre Dame, but Mack Brown’s North Carolina squad put together a solid 8-4 year that ended with an Orange Bowl appearance. And the Tar Heels are set up to follow up with a strong <a href=#>2021 NFL Draft</a> showing as well.</p><p>Our draft expert, Dane Brugler, had three North Carolina prospects (RB <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Javonte Williams</a>, WR <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dyami Brown</a>, LB <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Chazz Surratt</a>) ranked among <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his latest top 100</a>; he has both Williams and Michael Carter in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top five at running back</a>.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Of that group, Brown may have helped himself the most at North Carolina’s pro day Monday. He measured in at 6-foot, 189 pounds with big, 9 5/8-inch mitts. Brown also ran a 4.46 40, a 6.87 three-cone and broad jumped 130 inches. Several of his marks compared favorably to an ultra-productive NFL receiver that Brugler mentioned as a potential comp: “Overall, Brown isn’t quite as reliable as <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Stefon Diggs</a>, but he has similar size, speed and fluid adjustment skills.”</p><p>Surratt, a QB-turned-linebacker, ran two solid 40s: 4.58 and 4.6 seconds. At 6-2, 229 (and with 25 bench-press reps to his credit), those numbers will continue to sell Surratt as a freaky athlete for his position.</p><p>The two backs are interesting … and different. Williams (5-9, 212) probably projects more as a between-the-tackles option, so his 4.55 40 shouldn’t hold him back; his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> 36-inch vertical and 4.09 short shuttle might push teams the other way, toward digging his size/athleticism combo. Carter (5-7, 201) is more of a multifaceted complement — his 3.98 short shuttle and 6.81 three-cone ought to stand out.</p><h3>March 26: Did Zach Wilson do enough for Jets?</h3><p>As far as pro days go, it doesn’t get much wilder than BYU quarterback <a href=#>Zach Wilson</a>’s throwing session Friday. While Wilson was buzzing the ball all over the field, in front of reps from 31 NFL teams, the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dolphins</a>, 49ers and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Eagles</a> were putting the finishing touches on a <a href=#>pair of trades</a> that completely <a href=#>shook up</a> the 2021 NFL Draft.</p><p>Those moves resulted in San Francisco holding the No. 3 pick … which still may put the 49ers <a href=#>one spot too low</a> to add Wilson.</p><p>Wilson (6-2, 214 with 9 1/2-inch hands) put on a clinic that may have cemented his stock as QB2, just behind <a href=#>Trevor Lawrence</a>.

He weighed in at 6-5, 305 and then ran a sub-4.9 40, with a 34-inch vertical, 124-inch broad jump and 30 reps on the bench press. He’s a very safe bet to hear his name called on Day 2.</p><h3>Michigan results for <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kwity Paye</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nico Collins</a>, Jaylen Mayfield</h3><p dir=ltr>A slew of draft hopefuls, including likely first-round edge prospect Kwity Paye and wide receiver Nico Collins, worked out Friday in Ann Arbor for Michigan’s pro day.</p><p dir=ltr>Paye, No. 19 on Dane Brugler’s big board this winter, measured in at 6-2, 261, with a 78 4/8-inch wingspan (and 10-inch hands).

He did not bench press; his wingspan measured at 79 6/8 inches.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p dir=ltr>Mayfield could be one of the top tackles off the board, possibly in the first round.

Penn State’s <a href=#>Micah Parsons</a> already was in position to join that lineage before Thursday, but his pro day might have cemented his stock.</p><p>Parsons, at a rocked-up 6-foot-3, 246 pounds, ran a surprising 4.39-second 40-yard dash to highlight a strong workout. Every NFL team but the Rams — they’re still not really traveling for pre-draft evaluations — was in attendance.</p><p>“I think I showed my talents very well,” Parsons told the NFL Network’s Kim Jones. “I showed them exactly the type of competitor I am. I showed them how they can utilize me in different ways — I think I’m probably one of the most versatile players in this draft, and I’m able to be used anywhere on the field. Obviously, with my speed, it helps.”</p><p>Parsons opted out of the 2020 season, so this was the first up-close chance NFL evaluators had to see him in action since Dec. 28, 2019, in the Cotton Bowl. Suffice it to say, Parsons probably took himself out of the running for at least half the teams in attendance Thursday, because he won’t make it deep into Round 1.</p><p>Whether his teammate, edge <a href=#>Jayson Oweh</a>, joins him within the first 32 picks remains to be seen.

St. Brown, Tufele, Tuipulotu and Hufanga were all top-100 prospects on Brugler’s winter big board.</p><h3><strong>South Carolina, Michigan State updates</strong></h3><p>South Carolina cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jaycee Horn</a>’s stock could be on the rise after a speedy pro day performance in Columbia. On the other side of the ball, Gamecocks wide receiver <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Shi Smith</a> built off an impressive Senior Bowl week with another strong workout.</p><p>Horn was Dane Brugler’s No. 3-ranked corner this winter (No. 20 overall). A long, physical corner with speed, he measured at 6 feet, 205 pounds, with one unofficial 40-yard dash time of 4.37 seconds, per Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy. Horn’s arms measured at 33 inches.</p><p>Smith, a 5-foot-9, 186-pound route technician, ran a 4.43 with a 36-inch vertical leap and a 10-foot, 3-inch broad jump. His 3-cone time, per Nagy, was 6.83. That would’ve tied for the fifth-fastest among all players at the 2020 combine and put Smith No. 2 among wide receivers last year.</p><p>At Michigan State, cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Shakur Brown</a> measured at 5-foot-9, 186 pounds. That’s a bit smaller than advertised while with the Spartans. He turned in a 4.61-second 40, per Nagy, with a 3-cone time of 7.08.

He had some throws dropped and a bit of trouble with a few slot fades and some pressure early in the session, but most of the throws that earned him yards in college were&nbsp;were delivered as advertised.</p><p>Jones’ biggest asset in the eyes of many scouts — his ability to progress through reads in live action — wasn’t on display in an event like this, but he did deliver on a few on-point deep shots to wide receivers who won’t be picked in the first round next month. Athletically, Jones reportedly ran a 4.86-second 40-yard dash at 6-foot-2, 217 pounds. He also recorded a 32-inch vertical leap. Perhaps a notch faster than some might have thought, but in line with what we’ve seen from Jones’ game film.</p><p>Jones, Dane Brugler’s No. 40-ranked player (QB5) this winter, is expected to throw again at the Tide’s next pro day on March 30.</p><p>Elsewhere, Alabama offensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alex Leatherwood</a> checked in at 6-foot-5, 312 pounds, and had a terrific testing afternoon. Leatherwood reportedly ran a 4.96 40 with a 34.5-inch vertical leap and a broad jump of 9 feet, 10 inches.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alex Leatherwood is a OT prospect in the 2021 draft class. He scored a 9.86 RAS out of a possible 10.00.

Leatherwood is the No. 38-ranked player on Brugler’s big board, while Brown comes in at No. 50.</p><p>Star corner Patrick Surtain II, meantime, looked the part of CB1 in just about every area. He measured in at 6-2, 203 pounds. He ran a 4.42 40 with a 39-inch vertical leap and a broad jump of 10 feet, 11 inches. He also put up 18 reps of 225 pounds. An outstanding display of athleticism for Surtain, the son of former Pro Bowl corner Patrick Surtain Sr.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>His defensive teammate, DT <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Christian Barmore</a>, measured in at 6-4, 310 pounds, and reportedly ran a terrific 4.93 (per Nagy). Barmore was the top-rated defensive tackle (No. 18 overall) on Brugler’s big board this winter.</p><h3><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Rondale Moore</a> reminds everyone why he’s a top talent</h3><p>If you were worried about Purdue wide receiver <a href=#>Rondale Moore</a>’s durability — he played just seven total games over the past two seasons — then his numbers Tuesday probably didn’t ease your mind. Moore measured in at 5-foot-7, two inches below his already small frame listed on the Boilermakers’ website.</p><p>If you’re a fan of, well, everything else about Moore’s game, though …</p><p lang=es dir=ltr>. <a href=#>@moore_rondale</a> unofficial, 4.29–40. 🔥🔥🔥<a href=#>@nflnetwork</a> <a href=#>@BoilerFootball</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/G9aP0WRnTE</a></p><p>— StaceyDales (@StaceyDales) <a href=#>March 23, 2021</a></p><p>That’s an unofficial 4.29 40, which came not long after Moore showed off a 42.5-inch vertical. And, while Moore didn’t lift at pro day, he <a href=#>tweeted out a video</a> of himself knocking out 24 bench-press reps at an earlier workout.</p><p>The concerns about Moore’s height and consistent health are reasonable, but he was a highlight waiting to happen when he did suit up in college and has the top-end athleticism to translate that production to the pros. As a freshman back 2018, Moore had 1,471 yards from scrimmage and 14 touchdowns on 135 touches — he was must-see TV at all moments.</p><p>Purdue prospect <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Derrick Barnes</a> also made some noise during Tuesday’s pro day. Senior Bowl executive director <a href=#>Jim Nagy tweeted</a> that Barnes (6-0, 238) is the “best least-talked-about” linebacker in this class, and provided these numbers from Barnes’ workout:</p><ul><li>33 3/8-inch arm length (81 3/8-inch wingspan)</li><li>4.57-second, NFL-verified 40 time</li><li>37-inch vertical</li><li>29 reps on the bench press</li></ul><p>That’s a Day 3 prospect to remember.</p><h3><strong>March 22: Northern Iowa shows off two sleepers</strong></h3><p>We didn’t want to overlook a couple of eye-popping, small-school outings from Northern Iowa’s pro day Monday. First, there was 6-6, 262-pound edge <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Elerson Smith</a> elevating for a 41.5-inch vertical (he tweeted out <a href=#>the video evidence</a>), in addition to a 127-inch broad jump.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Then, there was the money-making performance from Spencer Brown, the <a href=#>No. 12 offensive tackle</a> in this class on Dane Brugler’s board. At 6-8 and 310-plus pounds, Brown ran a 4.88 40, 4.44 short shuttle (Smith was at 4.39) and a 7.03 three-cone (Smith: 7.0 flat). More from Dane: “Brown’s tight end and basketball background are clear with his smooth movements and natural body flexibility, which allow him to mirror and handle space.”</p><p>He calls Brown an “ideal developmental project” at tackle. With those testing numbers, any team hoping to take that ride might have to jump early on Day 3, if not before Day 2 is out.</p><h3><strong>FSU’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Joshua Kaindoh</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Janarius Robinson</a> impress</strong></h3><p>Florida State cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Asante Samuel Jr</a>. might be the program’s top prospect heading into the 2021 draft. But two FSU edge defenders put up some head-turning numbers at the school’s pro day Monday.</p><p>Joshua Kaindoh (6-5, 260) put together an all-around impressive athletic performance with a 4.7-second 40, a 36.5-inch vertical and a 10-foot, 5-inch broad jump (numbers per Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy). Terrific explosion and high-end speed for an edge prospect with good length. Janarius Robinson (6-5, 263), meantime, had a similarly impressive day. Robinson, per Nagy’s numbers, ran a 4.72 40 with a 1.64 10-yard split. He had a 34-inch vertical with a 10-foot, one-inch broad jump.</p><p>Kaindoh, a former five-star recruit, dealt with a bunch of injuries toward the back half of his time at FSU and never really had a true breakout year. Still, he will be an intriguing name for many. Robinson didn’t have big numbers at FSU, but like Kaindoh, he’s a terrific athlete with a great edge profile.</p><p>Samuel, meantime, recorded a 4.45-second 40 with a 10-foot, 4-inch broad jump. He measured 5-feet-10, 180 pounds, and did 12 bench reps. Safety hybrid <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Hamsah Nasirildeen</a>, per Nagy, did not run the 40 due to a hamstring injury. He did measure in at 6-3, 215 pounds.</p><h3><strong>DeVonta Smith will let his 2020 performance stand</strong></h3><p>Any interested NFL teams hoping to get another on-field look at Alabama receiver <a href=#>DeVonta Smith</a>, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, are out of luck. Smith said during the Crimson Tide’s media availability Monday that he won’t be taking part in any drills at pro day Tuesday.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Normally, it wouldn’t be unheard of for a high-profile prospect to sit out his school’s pro day or skip a few drills at the combine. This year, of course, is different because the latter event was canceled due to COVID-19 concerns and teams still are not permitted to bring in prospects for pre-draft meetings. (They used to have an allotment of 30 visits.)</p><p>So, barring a change of heart, the remainder of Smith’s NFL evaluation will boil down to whatever he’s already put on tape — admittedly, an awful lot that’s impressive — and his virtual meetings.</p><p>Also of note: Smith said that he currently weighs 170 pounds, which is down slightly from where Alabama had him listed (175 pounds). In either case, he’s extremely light for his position. Will that impact him negatively come draft time? It depends how sold GMs are that his ridiculously productive college performance translates to more physical coverage at the next level. Smith caught 117 passes for 1,856 yards and 23 TDs during his award-winning 2020.</p><p>That weight on its own isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker. Marvin Harrison was 181 back before the 1991 draft, landed in Round 1 and put together one of the league’s all-time productive careers at wide receiver.</p><p>But teams hoping for confirmation about Smith’s athletic traits or speed or anything else will have to look elsewhere.</p><h3><strong>Iowa’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Daviyon Nixon</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Chauncey Golston</a> show even more</strong></h3><p>Disruptive Iowa defensive tackle Daviyon Nixon was already considered one of the best interior line prospects in this draft. On Monday during the school’s pro day, he showed off a bit more.</p><p>Nixon checked in at 6-3, 313 pounds and ran a 4.90 40-yard dash. A junior college transfer, Nixon ripped through just about everyone on Iowa’s schedule last season, racking up 13 tackles for loss in seven games. He also logged a 4.70 20-yard shuttle time.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The former Hawkeye ranked No. 39 on Dane Brugler’s big board this winter, the No. 2-rated defensive tackle in the draft.</p><p>Edge prospect Chauncey Golston checked in at 6-4, 269 pounds, and turned in a 4.79 40-yard dash with a 36-inch vertical leap. His broad jump number was 9 feet, 11 inches, and he put up 22 reps of 225 pounds on the bench.</p><p>Not bad at all for Golston, who was already an intriguing late-round prospect from a school that regularly produces disciplined and relentless line prospects.</p><h3><strong>Missouri’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tyree Gillespie</a> speeds up the board</strong></h3><p>Don’t sleep on Missouri’s prospects in this draft class. Dane Brugler has linebacker <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nick Bolton</a> ranked No. 4 at that position, Tyree Gillespie is a highly intriguing safety for the mid-rounds, and running back <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Larry Rountree III</a> put together a steady Senior Bowl week.</p><p>The Tigers were up on the pro-day circuit Monday. Gillespie (5-11, 206) opened some eyes here:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watch: Former <a href=#>#Mizzou</a> safety Tyree Gillespie (<a href=#>@PutReekIn</a>) ran a 4.38 and a 4.40 at Pro Day. 👀 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZRzSQIkq8k</a></p><p>— Andrew Kauffman (@AndrewABC17) <a href=#>March 22, 2021</a></p><p>Gillespie’s other testing numbers (4.39-second short shuttle, 7.06 three-cone) weren’t as explosive, but they also shouldn’t ruin his stock — current NFL safeties like Bradley McDougald and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Adrian Amos</a> were in those ranges; several of Gillespie’s marks lined up with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Keanu Neal</a>’s 2016 pre-draft work.</p><p>Bolton, on the other hand, might need teams to look past his pro day. At 5-11, 237, he ran 40s of 4.59 and 4.60, with a 7.4 three-cone and 4.5-second short shuttle. The Round 1 buzz Bolton had been hearing might cool a bit, although there’s still plenty from last season to keep him in the late-Day 1/Day 2 conversation.</p><p>A pro-day highlight from elsewhere in Missouri:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some 👀 Pro Day numbers for Central Missouri TE *and* punter <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Zach Davidson</a> (6-6 5/8, 245):</p><p>37.5-inch vert would’ve topped <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cole Kmet</a> from last year’s combine as No. 1 for TEs</p><p>4.62 40 and 6.95 3-cone both would’ve ranked 2nd at TE</p><p>First-team D2 All-American in 2019 (15 TDs).</p><p>— Kevin Fishbain (@kfishbain) <a href=#>March 22, 2021</a></p><p>Yes, that is correct: punter/tight end Zach Davidson.

Michigan — featuring possible first-rounders Kwity Paye and Jalen Mayfield — is also scheduled for Friday, along with Boston College, Virginia Tech and South Dakota State.</p><h3><strong>March 19: TCU’s Trevon Moehrig, Ar’Darius Washington on display</strong></h3><p>TCU safeties Trevon Moehrig and Ar’Darius Washington had their turn to show what they’ve got Friday during the Horned Frogs’ pro day. Both players have the attention of NFL evaluators, notably Moehrig, whose stock has seemed to rise with some regularity this offseason.</p><p>Moehrig, a 6-foot-2, 202-pound free safety with plenty of coverage skills — both in man and zone — turned in a 4.5-second 40-yard dash with a 10-yard split of 1.59, per the NFL Network’s Jane Slater. Moehrig also recorded a 33-inch vertical leap.</p><p>The Thorpe Award winner last season, Moehrig was the top safety on Dane Brugler’s big board earlier this winter and the No. 33-ranked player overall. Known for his coverage savvy, Moehrig broke up 28 passes and picked off seven during 34 games at TCU.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>He can get downhill, he’s always around the ball and his lack of noted holes as a back-end defender could push him toward the first round.</p><p>Washington, meantime, ran a 4.61-second 40 with a 37.5-inch vertical leap. The issue here, of course, is size — but not talent. Washington’s a 5-foot-8, 178-pound safety with outstanding football IQ and confidence. He played in the slot, in the box and at deep safety inside Gary Patterson’s defense at TCU and is another intriguing candidate who could get second-day looks.</p><h3><strong>March 18: Don’t forget about Stanford QB <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Davis Mills</a></strong></h3><p>The quarterback conversation surrounding this draft has been fixated — rightly so — on the top four passers in this class. One of the underneath guys, though, made sure no one forgot about him Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Stanford quarterback <a href=#>Davis Mills</a> went through his pro day workout in front of more than 50 scouts. Even with some nasty weather, Mills seemed to get plenty accomplished.</p><p>The 6-foot-4, 225-pounder turned in, per Stanford, a 40-yard dash time of 4.58 seconds before taking the field and going through an extensive throwing workout in a rain storm. Mills was a former five-star recruit (ranked as the No. 1 overall pro-style quarterback in 2017) but wound up with only 11 starts in college, all in 2019 and 2020.</p><p>“Davis is from Georgia, he’s played in thunderstorms that look nothing like this,” Stanford coach David Shaw said on NFL Network. “His grip on the ball never wavered. You see the ball pop off his hand, the deep balls and underneath throws.</p><p>“There’s something natural that you have to see in an NFL quarterback. I think Davis has that.”</p><p>Still, Mills has plenty of physical ability. His feet are outstanding and while he wasn’t too much of a run threat in college he does have more than enough foot speed to move the pocket and avoid rushers in the passing game. He has improvisational skills and is efficient with most of his underneath throws, which was on display during Thursday’s rain-soaked workout.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Athletic’s Dane Brugler slotted Mills as his No. 6-ranked quarterback in this class, behind Alabama’s Mac Jones and the top four of Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields, Zach Wilson and Trey Lance. A Day 2 landing spot certainly seems possible.</p><p>“He answered the bell,” NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah said after Mills’ workout. “A lot of pressure on Davis Mills. Only 11 starts, no combine, no all-star games. This was his one shot and I thought he crushed it. A really clean, really pure throwing session in the rain.</p><p>“Today really could not have gone any better for Davis Mills.”</p><h3><strong>Two Auburn WRs perform well; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Central Arkansas’ Robert Rochell</a> rises</strong></h3><p>Another day, another blazing-fast 40 time in this draft cycle — players being able to run on home turf isn’t hurting.

The 6-foot, 186-pounder was the 2018 Gatorade Track & Field Athlete of the Year and he’s a past U-20 medalist on the international stage. Will that be enough to push Schwartz into Day 2 or early Day 3 of the draft? We’ll see. Dane Brugler didn’t have him among his top-20 receivers, and the 40-yard dash (and 32-inch vertical and 10-3 broad jump) might only do so much. Everyone knew he could fly.</p><p>Another wide receiver, <a href=#>Seth Williams</a>, does rank in Brugler’s top 20, at No. 16. And, as a bigger receiver (6-3, 211), he may have boosted his stock Thursday with a 4.5 40 and a 37-inch vertical, among other things. From Brugler’s write-up: “He projects as an NFL possession receiver with starting ability.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Bonus numbers from the March 18 pro days: Central Arkansas sleeper CB <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Robert Rochell</a> dropped some big marks, reportedly with 22 NFL teams in attendance. Senior Bowl executive director Jim Nagy tweeted out that Rochell ran (an unofficial) 4.39 and 4.45 in the 40, with a 43-inch vertical and 6.83-second three-cone. Strong marks for the 5-11, 196-pound defender.</p><h3><strong>March 17: <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Josh Imatorbhebhe</a>’s eye-popping vertical jump</strong></h3><p>Illinois wide receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe made a few waves on social media Wednesday when images of his vertical jump started to surface.</p><p>Per Jeremy Werner of 247Sports, Imatorbhebhe recorded a vertical jump of 46.5 inches.

Good news there: After measuring in with a massive 34 3/8-inch arm length, Ojulari posted 26 reps on the bench during Georgia’s pro day on Wednesday. He then turned in two 40-yard dash times in the mid-4.6s and a 10-foot, 7-inch broad jump.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Ojulari was smooth and comfortable during linebacker positional drills, too, showing the footwork to handle dropping into coverage — a must, with a lot of teams viewing him as a 3-4 or hybrid edge.</p><p>“(He’s) done really well,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart told the SEC Network during Ojulari’s workout. “Azeez is a guy, he’s high-character, high-athlete, but people questioned what his movement skills were, what his straight-line 40 speed was. I think he helped himself tremendously today.”</p><p>Cornerback Eric Stokes, meanwhile, was out to prove that his <a href=#>4.24 40-yard dash</a> at the House of Athlete showcase was legit. His unofficial marks Wednesday, per the SEC Network: 4.28 and 4.32. (Senior Bowl executive director Jim Nagy, who was part of the TV coverage, had Stokes at 4.25 and 4.29, each time with a 10-yard split under 1.6 seconds.)</p><p>“Speed-wise, it was just another day,” Stokes told the SEC Network. “I just had to come out here and prove, like, ‘Hey, man: This is actually a 4.2 here. This is my speed.’”</p><p>Stokes was frustrated by some drops during positional drills: “That’s the only thing that killed me.” All in all, though, it was another strong day for him.</p><p>Fellow cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tyson Campbell</a> also landed in the high 4.2s to mid-4.3s in the 40, unofficially. And linebacker <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Monty Rice</a> crept down under the 4.6 line — he has Day 2 potential.</p><p>Offensive lineman <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ben Cleveland</a> had set a staggering bench-press goal of 50 (!) headed into the day. He fell well short, with 30 reps, but then ran an unofficial 4.85 40 at 343 pounds. That athleticism, at his size, should land him in a nice spot come draft weekend.</p><h3><strong>Pitt’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jaylen Twyman</a> shows his power</strong></h3><p>Jaylen Twyman, a 290-pound interior tackle with a lot of power was able to, per reports, put up 40 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press at Pitt’s pro day.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Former Eastern Kentucky defensive tackle Justin Ernest can still feel safe about his 51 reps in 1999 (at the combine), but 40 reps is definitely rare air for Twyman, who ranks No. 10 on Brugler’s DT board.

Newman, who transferred to Georgia from Wake Forest, never played for the Bulldogs after opting out of the 2020 season.</p><p>Nick Baumgardner posed some questions for Seth about what to expect from the players who will participate Wednesday.</p><p><strong>Azeez Ojulari might be the best edge prospect in this draft and he’s all burst off the edge. He’s not super long, he’s pretty light, but he has electric pass-rushing traits. What’s the ceiling here?</strong></p><p>Ojulari is a well-rounded player capable of playing every down — as he did at Georgia, which is loaded with outside linebackers but tried not to take Ojulari off the field except to rest him. Ojulari’s size, while not that small, may ultimately keep him from leading the NFL in sacks, but his energy and intelligence will get him in the backfield plenty. Run defense is a strength, and in a pinch he can help in pass coverage. Plus he’s a high-character guy who should help in the locker room. Ojulari could be an NFL starter for the next decade, and there’s All-Pro potential.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Eric Stokes turned heads earlier this month with a 4.25 40-yard dash, so speed isn’t a question. There have been questions about overall agility and his ability to play without grabbing. Stokes has already helped himself this offseason. How can he help more?</strong></p><p>Stokes is probably in do-no-harm mode at Georgia’s pro day. The college film is already out there, and it shows that he’s a very good but not shutdown cornerback. Then again, Stokes can point to how he faced elite receivers (Alabama, LSU, Florida) over the years, and it was Georgia’s other cornerback — Tyson Campbell — who emerged the worse for wear. Stokes, meanwhile, offers an intriguing blend of speed and height, and should interview well. (He has a bright and bubbly personality.) The knock on him may be weight strength, so maybe some impressive bench numbers make NFL teams think about using a late first-rounder on him.</p><p><strong>Ben Cleveland has been a giant human inside Georgia’s OL for what seems like a decade. Big, sturdy, dependable guard. The question we’re all here for, though: Is he going to break the bench-press record?</strong></p><p>It’s possible! There’s a reason they’ve been calling him Big Ben since high school. Cleveland is an interesting prospect: A fifth-year senior who became a very consistent, and good, guard as his college career wound down. But he began at tackle, and with his size, some NFL teams may be tempted to try him there, or draft him because of his versatility. If you told me Cleveland would start for the next 10-15 years, I wouldn’t be surprised.</p><p><strong>Monty Rice probably has to answer some strength questions but he has speed for days. Georgia has so many guys who can run. Is Stokes the fastest guy on the team and how many of these 40 times might turn a head or two this week?</strong></p><p>Stokes may be smart not to run at the pro day — let that 40 time from last month stand as the last impression. Rice isn’t going to wow anybody with any single measurable, but he was just one of those gets-the-job-done inside linebackers. Tyson Campbell and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Richard LeCounte</a> may be the most closely watched guys at the pro day: Campbell is trying to push into the first round, while LeCounte is trying to show he’s healthy and push into second-day consideration. LeCounte — a former five-star prospect who improved every year at Georgia — was a team leader who hasn’t been talked about much because he was injured the latter part of the 2020 season. He’s got sneaky potential as a starter who someone grabs in the middle rounds.</p><h3><strong>March 15: </strong><strong>Kent State’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Isaiah McKoy</a> not as speedy as hoped</strong></h3><p>Kent State has produced a bunch of quality NFL players through the years, and the turnout for wide receiver Isaiah McKoy’s pro day workout Monday shows that McKoy isn’t really a secret in a deep wide receiver group this spring.</p><p>An early entry to this year’s draft, McKoy averaged 18.2 yards per reception in his final college season and was invited to this year’s NFL combine. Because the combine was canceled, the pro day workout represented McKoy’s only chance to perform for the eyes of the NFL in the pre-draft process. Twenty NFL teams were represented at the pro day, most by area scouts. Kent State coach Sean Lewis told The Athletic that 24 teams had inquired about McKoy and/or his pro day workout by March 1.</p><p>McKoy measured at 6-feet-2 and weighed 200 pounds. He did 12 reps on the 225-pound bench press, and one scout clocked him at 4.58 and 4.62 in his two 40-yard dash tries. McKoy had been hoping for faster, as his three seasons of game tape show that he was a bona fide deep threat at the college level. McKoy’s size and athleticism make him an intriguing Day 3 draft prospect and a developmental deep threat at the NFL level. — Zac Jackson</p><h3><strong>March 12: Trey Lance shows off big arm, says he’s ready to compete</strong></h3><p>On Friday, all eyes focused on Trey Lance and his right arm. As is often the case, neither disappointed.</p><p>The dynamic 20-year-old North Dakota State quarterback showed scouts and NFL organizations everything his arm can do during a quick-paced, 66-throw pro day workout in Fargo. Lance, who’s projected as a top-10 pick in the draft, chose not to participate in any speed testing during the event. He did, however, go through a variety of different routes and situational drills with his arm.</p><p>Lance, flanked by personal quarterback coach Quincy Avery, worked with pace and precision — and drew rounds of applause on a number of occasions with deep shots and laser-like ropes from the pocket.</p><p>“I was looking forward to this. Six months, it’s been a long time since I got to throw at the Fargodome,” Lance said via Zoom afterward, adding that it was exciting “to go out and show what I’ve got. Felt like we had a good day.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trey Lance is showing off his arm strength at <a href=#>@NDSUFootball</a> Pro Day 💪 <a href=#>@treylance09</a></p><p>📺: <a href=#>@nflnetwork</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Ki2y5qOWeJ</a></p><p>— NFL (@NFL) <a href=#>March 12, 2021</a></p><p>Lance did not answer questions about which teams he’s met with during the pre-draft process but maintained he’s confident he’ll be a fit for any organization in need of a quarterback. Asked if he believes he’s ready to start in the NFL right now, Lance — who played in only 19 games at FCS NDSU — said he’ll be ready to compete for whatever comes his way.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>On the field Friday, most everything with Lance’s arm looked familiar, and impressive. The ball can sail on Lance’s intermediate throws, and that was on display a bit during Friday’s workout. His misses were small; they can be fine-tuned.</p><p>Lance’s draw, though, was on full display Friday: The explosion he generates when he drives the ball off his back foot might be unmatched in this draft. When Lance is able to get his feet under him in the pocket, either via a straight drop or play action, the ball just hums.</p><p>In short: He makes the hard look easy.</p><p>“There was improvement from what you saw on tape in the fall. Which is encouraging to me. He was very crisp; being under center is not new to him. Being able to set up in the pocket, that was good,” NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah said after Lance’s workout. “(His) short, front stride — he’s shortened that out a little bit, gets his foot in the ground and you saw more rotation with his upper body.</p><p>“The footwork was outstanding. … The other thing (they) wanted to showcase was his delivery. There are times he can get a little elongated and the ball will drop down a little bit, I thought he was more consistent with that today.”</p><p>Lance threw for 2,947 yards, 30 touchdowns and one interception (with 1,325 rushing yards and 18 scores) at North Dakota State. And while he didn’t run the 40 or do any agility work Friday, Lance’s ability to both move and leave the pocket with his legs is certainly part of his appeal.</p><p>Per NFL Network, Lance’s fastest run of the 2019 season — a 44-yard touchdown — topped out at 21.54 miles per hour.</p><p>“I think that’s one of my strengths. To move the pocket, get out of the pocket, make plays with my legs,” Lance said. “Today, I wanted to show I can make throws from the pocket … which is what I did.”</p><p>Afterward, Lance dealt with plenty of questions about which current or former NFL quarterback best compares to his game. In working with Avery, Lance has been able to spend time with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Deshaun Watson</a>. There have been <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cam Newton</a> comparisons. Jeremiah brought up Steve McNair.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Lance?</p><p>“At the end of the day, I’m Trey Lance,” he said. “I’m not anybody else.”</p><h3><strong>Oklahoma center <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Creed Humphrey</a> could go top 50 … or higher</strong></h3><p>Oklahoma has produced a first-round pick in each of the past three years (and multiple first-rounders in both 2019 and ‘20). Possibly the Sooners’ best hope of continuing that streak in 2021: offensive lineman Creed Humphrey, whom The Athletic draft expert <a href=#>Dane Brugler has ranked</a> as the top center in this class.</p><p>And Humphrey absolutely helped his cause Friday:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some 👀 Pro Day results from Oklahoma center Creed Humphrey.</p><p>He ran a 4.46 20-yard shuttle, which would’ve tied <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ezra Cleveland</a> for No. 1 among O-linemen at last year’s combine.</p><p>7.54 3-cone time would’ve ranked 3rd. His 33-inch vertical would’ve tied for 5th.</p><p>— Kevin Fishbain (@kfishbain) <a href=#>March 12, 2021</a></p><p>The Big 12’s Offensive Lineman of the Year this past season, Humphrey also fired off 29 reps on the bench press. If he wasn’t already, Humphrey now stands as a safe bet to land within the top 50. And, given the increased emphasis teams have shown on drafting guards and centers early, he might even be able to push up into Round 1.</p><p>“Centers have become more valuable in the last couple years,” Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said on a Zoom news conference after the pro day workout. “You go ask people who the best defensive linemen are in the league, a lot of them are inside guys. If you’re playing against the best, you better have your best in there, too. I think a guy that’s a talent like his, I think he’s got a shot to be drafted really high. The trend of the league will certainly help him with that.”</p><p>Oklahoma’s other Round 1 hopeful is <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ronnie Perkins</a>, Brugler’s No. 10 edge. The 6-foot-2, 253-pound Perkins took some reps dropping in coverage, which he said was at the <a href=#>request of some of the NFL teams</a> there — he could fit in multiple schemes.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tre Brown</a> kept his draft momentum moving in the right direction, too. After being voted the American team’s top defensive back at the Senior Bowl, Brown (nearly 5-10, 185 pounds) followed up by running a 4.4 Friday, with a 38-inch vertical and broad jump over 10 feet.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Quick turnover. <a href=#>@T_Brown25</a> 💨</p><p>🎥 <a href=#>https://t.co/XhOdfeJeYP</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/h0E6Byesbu</a></p><p>— Oklahoma Football (@OU_Football) <a href=#>March 12, 2021</a></p><h3></h3><h3>March 11: Clemson’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Travis Etienne</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Amari Rodgers</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cornell Powell</a> help stock</h3><p>The main event delivered. But, as is often the case at Clemson, there was so much more to see.</p><p>Standout running back Travis Etienne certainly <a href=#>helped his stock</a> with a pair of 4.40 40-yard dash runs — at a bulked-up 215 pounds — as the Tigers went through their pro day Thursday. But receivers Amari Rodgers and Cornell Powell showed what they can do, too.</p><p>Rodgers, a 5-foot-9, 211-pound slot receiver, logged a 4.45 on his first 40-yard sprint and a 4.44 on his second. He also, per Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy, recorded a 33-inch vertical and a 10-foot, 1-inch broad jump.</p><p>More than numbers, though, he put his full skill set on display by taking reps in the backfield as a running back, catching punts and running routes as a receiver. He’s a multi-tool prospect who could be dangerous in the right system. Rodgers’ stock climbed after a great Senior Bowl, and he also had an impressive workout at the House of Athlete scouting combine last week (see details below from March 7). So his stock may be on the rise again.</p><p>“I’m comfortable in the slot. But the biggest thing with me, I started at outside receiver through my junior year. Inside, outside, they can put me in the backfield,” Rodgers, the son of former Tennessee star quarterback and current <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Baltimore Ravens</a> assistant Tee Martin, told ACC Network. “I’m trying to show how versatile I am … you can put me in the backfield and I think I can make plays.”</p><p>Powell, meantime, looked to be in outstanding shape at 6 feet, 204 pounds. He ran a 4.47 40-yard dash and, per Nagy, scored a 36.5-inch vertical leap. In 2020, Powell recorded career bests in catches (53), receiving yards (882) and touchdowns (seven).</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>After not recording more than 15 catches in any of his first four seasons at Clemson, Powell took full advantage of his fifth year. He was also able to put his route-running and receiving skills on display earlier this winter at Trevor Lawrence’s highly attended pro day.</p><p>“I never wanted to run from a challenge. I knew I was good enough to play at this level,” Powell said. “So I just put my head down and worked.”</p><h3><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Joseph Ossai</a> delivers at Texas</strong></h3><p>Looking for a potential late-Round 1 edge who’s been flying under the radar to this point?

Both Murray and Gay are more traditional off-ball linebackers; Simmons is a safety/linebacker hybrid.</p><p>Ossai has a good 10 to 20 pounds on all of them, so that explosive athleticism is all the more impressive.

While he plays quick, he wins more with effort than explosion and his body stiffness hinders his ability to win at the top of his rush. Overall, Ossai is a linear athlete who lacks fluidity in his rush or redirect, but his foot is always on the gas with the compete skills and locked-in effort that helps mask some of his issues. He projects as a physical 3-4 edge defender.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Not to be outdone, fellow Longhorn <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Sam Cosmi</a> — Brugler’s No. 6 offensive tackle — posted 36 reps on the bench and ran a 4.84 40 … at 6-7, 310.

It’ll be even tougher now.</p><p>Wildgoose, a former Wisconsin corner, logged some <a href=#>impressive speed times</a> Wednesday during the Badgers’ pro day in Madison. The 5-foot-11, 197-pounder ran a 4.41 40-yard dash with a 1.49-second 10-yard split.</p><p>His 40 time would’ve been a top-10 number at last year’s combine and the 10-yard split would’ve been one of the best by a cornerback a year ago in Indianapolis. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jeff Okudah</a>, drafted by the Lions at No. 3 in 2020, had the best cornerback 10-yard split a year ago at 1.47 seconds. Wildgoose also recorded a 120-inch broad jump, a 36-inch vertical and a 7-second 3-cone time. He benched 225 pounds 11 times.</p><p>Wildgoose only has two years of tape at Wisconsin, but his stock could be rising. An interesting corner early on Day 3, perhaps even late on Day 2.</p><p>Elsewhere at Wisconsin, offensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cole Van Lanen</a> (6-5, 312) put up 22 reps of 225 pounds with a 107-inch broad jump, a 30-inch vertical and a 5.01-second 40-yard dash (with a 1.69-second split). <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Isaiahh Loudermilk</a>, a 6-foot-7, 293-pound defensive end, registered a 4.95-second 40 with a 112-inch broad jump, a 28.5-inch vertical and 21 reps on the bench.</p><h3><strong>Arkansas’ <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Feleipe Franks</a>: From Red Sox to NFL?</strong></h3><p>All eyes will be on North Dakota State QB Trey Lance when he goes through his pro day Friday, but a handful of other quarterback prospects have their workouts this week, as well. That list includes Arkansas’ Feleipe Franks, who spent his first four college seasons at Florida, before suffering a broken ankle and then transferring.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>This actually could be the second time Franks has been drafted. The first came in 2019, when the Red Sox took him in Round 31 of the MLB Draft. Franks, who last played baseball during his junior year of high school, opted to stick with football but he sees the benefits of his multisport background.</p><p>“It’s not just me,” Frank said. “I think you can see it with different guys — the Tom Bradys, the Russell Wilsons, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a>. The arm angles, there’s so many different arm angles that you throw in the game of football as a quarterback. It definitely helps at the quarterback position.”</p><p>One other note from Arkansas’ pro day: Cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jerry Jacobs</a> told the media that he “one-thousand percent” regrets opting out of the 2020 season, noting that he didn’t really talk it over with anyone. The decision was not, Jacobs said, related to his health or COVID-19 concerns, but rather because he didn’t feel mentally ready for the season.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to track how candid other opt-out prospects are in explaining their reasoning or, in hindsight, whether they made the right call.</p><h3><strong>March 9: Big day for Northwestern’s Rashawn Slater, Greg Newsome II</strong></h3><p>Northwestern hasn’t produced a first-round draft pick since defensive tackle Luis Castillo in 2005, but the Wildcats could break that drought twice over this year. Offensive tackle Rashawn Slater will be there, for one. After opting out of the 2020 season, Slater solidified his status as a potential top-10 pick with an impressive pro day showing Tuesday.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rashawn Slater Pro Day:</p><p>• HT: 6042<br>• WT: 304<br>• Arm: 33”<br>• 40: 4.88 / 4.94<br>• 10-yard split: 1.68<br>• Bench: 33 reps<br>• 3 Cone: 7.48</p><p>— Jordan Reid (@Jordan_Reid) <a href=#>March 9, 2021</a></p><p>If there is any spot to nitpick, it would be in Slater’s size — the arm length, in particular. Slater said after his workout that teams hadn’t expressed much concern about his ability to play tackle, however. That length also won’t be as much of an issue for any team viewing him as an interior-line option, and those athletic testing marks (plus 33 bench-press reps) stand out regardless.</p><p>His teammate, cornerback Greg Newsome II, might have done even more to help his stock Tuesday. Not only did he check off a box by measuring in at 6 feet even, he posted an official 4.38-second 40-yard dash, per the NFL Network’s Stacey Dales on site, and a 40-inch vertical.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“Pop that tape on,” Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said, just prior to the workout. “As a corner, you’ve got to have a great, great, great demeanor about you. You’ve gotta have a high level of compete. You’ve got to have the hips and the feet and the top-end speed. But you’ve got to be able to be out there on the edge and be physical, and that’s Greg Newsome. And he’s physical. I call him a unicorn.”</p><h3><b data-stringify-type=bold>March 7: <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Georgia CB Eric Stokes Jr</a>. blazes a 4.24, plus other standouts</b></h3><p>Georgia cornerback Eric Stokes Jr. was the talk of the afternoon, but a slew of intriguing draft prospects worked out at Brandon Marshall’s <a href=#>House of Athlete pro day</a> in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Friday.</p><p>Stokes’ 4.24-second 40-yard dash was, perhaps, the highlight of the event as the Georgia corner, per The Athletic’s Josh Tolentino and Manny Navarro, topped out at a blazing 22.8 miles per hour.</p><p>Elsewhere? North Carolina linebacker Chazz Surratt had a 4.64 40-yard dash and 27 reps of 225 pounds. The 6-foot-2, 225-pounder was a top 40 prospect on Dane Brugler’s most recent top 100 big board.</p><p>For more insight, here’s a quick recap from Navarro.</p><p><strong>Nick Baumgardner:</strong> There were a number of pretty intriguing receivers on the workout list, which makes some sense, as House of Athlete is run by Brandon Marshall. Were there any guys from that position group who caught your eye?</p><p><strong>Manny Navarro:</strong> I thought Amari Rodgers looked really good and he only participated in the bench press on Thursday and Friday’s receiver drills showcase, catching passes from <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Senior Bowl MVP Kellen Mond</a> and Jeff George Jr. Rodgers put up a career-high 24 reps on the bench, which, according to Stathead, is second only to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>DK Metcalf</a> and N’<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Keal Harry</a> (both did 27 reps) since 2017. Rodgers looked really smooth running routes and catching passes on Friday.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>I’d also say Iowa’s Brandon Smith really looked athletic and dynamic. His agent likens him to Metcalf athletically and the comparison is not far off at all. The combine numbers Smith put up Friday were on par and though his 40 time wasn’t sub-4.5, he looks like he could be a really interesting pickup in the mid rounds.</p><p><strong>Baumgardner:</strong> We saw Eric Stokes’ 4.24 40-yard dash time on social media. A lot of speed on the field at this event. Were there any other times that jumped off the page?</p><p><strong>Navarro:</strong> LSU cornerback Kary Vincent ran a 4.38 on his first attempt and then a 4.3 on his second attempt laser-timed. Houston receiver <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Marquez Stevenson</a> ran a 4.4.</p><p><strong>Baumgardner:</strong> Obviously this isn’t the actual combine; people are doing their best to make it work. Can you give us a little insight on the protocol the event went through to ensure these times and numbers were all legit?</p><p><strong>Navarro:</strong> All events this week at HOA were recorded by Zybek Sports Timing System and sent to NFL teams. Zybek is the same company that records and charts pre-draft workouts at the NFL combine. Mo Wells, the program director, said there was also a full medical staff from Memorial Sports Medicine on hand to assist in “all measurables.”</p><p>“We really checked the boxes,” Wells said. “We also had credible position coaches come in and do the offensive and defensive work. We had coach Hue Jackson (and) <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ryan Clark</a>, former Pittsburgh Steeler, just to put a stamp on the entire event.”</p><h3><b data-stringify-type=bold>Iowa’s Brandon Smith sets the bar</b></h3><p>Stokes stole the show with his 40-yard dash at the HOA showcase, but Iowa’s Smith no doubt opened some eyes, too. He dropped a 136-inch broad jump, which would have ranked behind only <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Donovan Peoples-Jones</a> (139 inches), <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jalen Reagor</a> (138 inches) and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jeremy Chinn</a> (138 inches) at last year’s scouting combine. Smith then one-upped himself with a 44.75-inch vertical — that would have topped all 2020 combine participants; Peoples-Jones was well ahead of last year’s field with a 44.5-inch jump.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“This is just the beginning,” Smith <a href=#>told The Athletic’s Tolentino and Navarro</a>. “I know I can compete at any level.”</p><p>Smith is likely a late-round or UDFA prospect (Dane Brugler doesn’t have him among this class’ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top 20 receivers</a>), so his performance in Fort Lauderdale should be a boost. He’ll have an opportunity to back those impressive numbers at Iowa’s official pro day on March 22.</p><h3><b data-stringify-type=bold>Kansas, Pooka Williams open official pro day circuit</b></h3><p>Last year, the combine went off without a hitch, only for COVID-19 to force the cancellation of most pro days. The situation is flipped this year: There’s no combine (and no top-30 prospect visits to team facilities), but there is a long list of pro days tentatively scheduled between now and April 9.</p><p>First up: Kansas, where running back Pooka Williams and long snapper Logan Klusman went through drills on Friday for NFL teams. Williams was the draw. An electrifying playmaker, Williams (5-foot-8 1/2 and 175 pounds at the pro day) opted out of the 2020 college season after four games to be with his mother, who was battling an illness. She is “way better now,” Williams told reporters after his workout.</p><p>Williams ran a 4.38-second 40-yard dash — a reminder here that pro day speeds tend to be a bit juiced.
