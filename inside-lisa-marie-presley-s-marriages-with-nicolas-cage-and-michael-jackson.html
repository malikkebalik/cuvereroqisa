A year later, the pair had a daughter, Riley Keough and in 1992 they welcomed a son, Benjamin Keough.</p><p>They divorced two years later in 1994. In July 2020, Benjamin took his own life at 27 years old.</p><p>“‘He’s my absolute best friend in the world,” Presley said of her ex-husband in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2003 interview with Rolling Stone</a>. “The smartest thing I’ve ever done is have children with this man, because I knew this is the one man I could be connected to for the rest of my life.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Presley and Nicolas Cage were married from 2002 to 2004. <span class=credit>AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p>The pair remained lifelong friends and Presley said getting married so young had affected their relationship. She had moved in with Keough when she was just 17 years old and said he had struggled with her stardom, according to an interview she did with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marie Claire magazine in 2007.</a></p><p>“I had been really sheltered. I got married the first time very, very young. And the marriage I was in, there was so much resentment about who I was, because I had more than he did, and it became a power struggle,” she said.</p><p>Less than three weeks after her divorce to Danny Keough was finalized, Presley wed Jackson in a secret ceremony in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>“It is hard for a man to be with a woman who is stronger, wealthier,” she said of her switch from Keough to Jackson. “So in my mind I’m thinking,&nbsp;I know, I’ll get with someone more compatible.&nbsp;I wasn’t thinking what everyone else was thinking, which was that I must have been out of my fucking mind.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Presley and Cage at the “Windtalkers” premiere. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Presley and Jackson in 1995. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>At the time of her wedding to Jackson, Presley said she was “in love.”</p><p>“I am very much in love with Michael, I dedicate my life to being his wife,” Presley said in a statement. “I understand and support him. We both look forward to raising a family.”</p><p>However, the famous duo never had any children and called it quits after just two years of marriage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lisa Marie Presley 1968-2023</h2><p>She called marrying Jackson the “biggest mistake of her life” in the same Marie Claire interview.</p><p>“My biggest mistake? Let’s see,” she said in response to the reporter’s question. “How can I word this? Um. Well. Leaving my first marriage, for the person that I left it for — that was probably the biggest mistake of my life.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Presley and Jackson at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1994. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>Following Jackson’s death in 2009, however, Presley penned a blog post stating she “failed to help” him through his substance abuse problems and added that their short-lived relationship was real and “not ‘a sham’.”</p><p>“I wanted to save him from the inevitable which is what has just happened,” she wrote. “His family and his loved ones also wanted to save him from this as well but didn’t know how and this was 14 years ago. We all worried that this would be the outcome then.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2002, Presley wed another famous A-lister, Cage. The couple reportedly met while she was engaged to the musician John Oszajca — who proposed in 1999 — while Cage was still married to Patricia Arquette.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Presley and Cage met in 1999, while she was engaged to John Oszajca. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Cage told Barbara Walters in 2003 that he met Presley at a party and “was thunderstruck” by her.</p><p>“I walk into a party not knowing who I’m going to meet and there’s this beautiful girl standing in the middle of the living room wearing this short leather skirt and this fluffy jacket, and she looks up at me with these big, beautiful, soulful eyes, eyes that look like they have a sad story to tell, and I just went ‘Oh,'” Cage said.</p><p>They married in a ceremony in August 2002, but ended their relationship after only four months. They finalized their divorce in 2004.</p><p>“Marrying him was a wild flurry, a crazy idea and being young, and ‘Ahhhh!'” Presley said of Cage in 2007.</p><p>At the time of their divorce, she said they should have never married.</p><p>“I’m sad about this, but we shouldn’t have been married in the first place. It was a big mistake,” she said in a statement.</p><p>Presley’s fourth and final marriage was to guitarist Michael Lockwood in 2006. The couple exchanged vows in Japan with her first husband Keough serving as the best man.</p><p>Presley and Lockwood were married for 10 years and shared twin daughters Harper Vivienne Ann and Finley Aaron Love, whom Presley had in 2008.</p><p>While pregnant with his children, Presley told Marie Claire that Lockwood was her best friend.</p><p>“I’ve gotten to the point in my life where I’ve chased all the crazies down,” she told the publication.&nbsp;“I was ready to stop the madness. At this age, I really appreciate having [a husband who is] a best friend. But you know, the other guys were fun. For a while.”</p><p>Presley filed for divorce from Lockwood in 2016 and after a messy court and custody battle, their divorce was finalized in 2021.</p><p>Presely died in the hospital after suffering cardiac arrest at her Calabasas home. She is survived by her mother Priscilla Presley and children, Riley Keough, Finley Lockwood and Harper Lockwood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmampfnru0tcOeZKWho5Z6rq3RopxmqKKawK2x2Kxkppmip7ais8SsZLChpJ16r7XCqKOaq12YrqixjJqlnWWdnrCprcSlZKOZk6DAsLqO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-lisa-marie-presley-s-marriages-with-nicolas-cage-and-michael-jackson.html&text=Inside%20Lisa%20Marie%20Presley%27s%20marriages%20with%20Nicolas%20Cage%20and%20Michael%20Jackson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-lisa-marie-presley-s-marriages-with-nicolas-cage-and-michael-jackson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-lisa-marie-presley-s-marriages-with-nicolas-cage-and-michael-jackson.html&title=Inside%20Lisa%20Marie%20Presley%27s%20marriages%20with%20Nicolas%20Cage%20and%20Michael%20Jackson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-lisa-marie-presley-s-marriages-with-nicolas-cage-and-michael-jackson.html&title=Inside%20Lisa%20Marie%20Presley%27s%20marriages%20with%20Nicolas%20Cage%20and%20Michael%20Jackson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-lisa-marie-presley-s-marriages-with-nicolas-cage-and-michael-jackson.html&title=Inside%20Lisa%20Marie%20Presley%27s%20marriages%20with%20Nicolas%20Cage%20and%20Michael%20Jackson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-lisa-marie-presley-s-marriages-with-nicolas-cage-and-michael-jackson.html&description=Inside%20Lisa%20Marie%20Presley%27s%20marriages%20with%20Nicolas%20Cage%20and%20Michael%20Jackson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jordan-vandergriff.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jordan Vandergriff">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-tall-is-qt-twitch-the-talks-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Tall Is QT Twitch?
