The sum had also made him the world’s most expensive defender at that time.</li><li>In September 2003, while playing for Manchester United, he had missed a drug test due to which he was banned from competitive soccer for 8 months. The punishment had not only cost him a significant chunk of the domestic and European club season in 2004, it had also caused him to miss the Euro 2004 international competition.</li><li>This was just the start of a cursed relationship with the tournament for him as England had failed to qualify for the 2008 edition of the tournament and he was controversially left out of the squad for the 2012 edition. This meant that he never got a chance to represent England at the competition despite such a long and prolific career.</li><li>In December 2009, he founded the Live the Dream Foundation charity with the aim to provide education and employment opportunities for children.</li><li>In October 2014, Rio was charged by the FA for using offensive language on Twitter, after he had referred to the mother of a critic as a “sket”. He was reportedly fined £25,000 for the offense and was also banned from playing for three games.</li><li>In September 2017, he had announced that he had decided to become a professional boxer, primarily to cope with the death of his wife 2 years earlier; a tragedy that had pushed him to announce his retirement from competitive soccer. He quit boxing in May 2018 though, after the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) refused to grant him a professional boxing license.</li><li>In August 2020, Rio admitted to speeding on the A27 at Hangleton in Hove and was later banned from driving for 6 months. He had reportedly driven at 85 mph and was fined £822.</li><li>Rio was appointed ‘Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)’ during the 2022 Birthday Honours.</li><li>For his performances in the English club scene, he was included in the&nbsp;PFA ‘Premier League Team of the Year’ 6 times (2001–02, 2004–05, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2012–13). He was also included in the FIFPro ‘World XI’ for the 2007–08 season.</li><li>In April 2023, it was revealed that Rio’s son Lorenz had temporarily moved out of their home to live with another family.</li><p>Featured Image by Rio Ferdinand / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqugqGWWmr%2Bltc2apZ1n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frio-ferdinand-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html&text=Rio%20Ferdinand%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frio-ferdinand-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frio-ferdinand-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html&title=Rio%20Ferdinand%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frio-ferdinand-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html&title=Rio%20Ferdinand%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frio-ferdinand-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html&title=Rio%20Ferdinand%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frio-ferdinand-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html&description=Rio%20Ferdinand%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alex-woods.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Woods">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./louis-armstrong.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Louis Armstrong">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
