According to the source, Bea did not hate White but had trouble expressing her warm feelings.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, the late actress never got to air her side of the story before her death from cancer in 2009.

They had each other to lean on at that time. White previously <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://okmagazine.com/p/betty-white-birthday-golden-girls-bea-arthur-rue-mcclanahan-estelle-getty/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"You can't work that closely together and not become a family.

During the first season, McClanahan endured the end of her fifth marriage while White mourned the death of her husband, Allen Ludden. The two became sources of strength to each other.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHITE'S AND ARTHUR'S ACHIEVEMENTS</strong></p><p class=dh>White began her career as a local TV station assistant before launching her series called "Life with Elizabeth."</p><p class=dh>She became one of the first female producers in Hollywood, and throughout her career, has garnered many achievements, including seven Emmys and a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, Arthur started in off-Broadway plays and nightclub gigs before reaching fame on television. Her 1971 appearance on "All in the Family" made her a star, and soon CBS created a spinoff show called "Maude."</p><p class=dh>One of Arthur's most significant <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bea-arthurs-son-golden-girls-maude>achievements</a> was not in line with her career. Before her passing, the actress left $300,000 to a foundation for the homeless LGBTQ+ in New York City, which was later used to build a housing facility called Bea Arthur Residence.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ANOTHER HOLLYWOOD FEUD</strong></p><p class=dh>It appears Arthur and White are not the only Hollywood stars with known feuds. Marilyn Monroe and <a class="me a" href=#>Joan Crawford </a>were also on each other's wrong sides, primarily because of the shared attention they got in the 1953 Golden Globes.</p><p class=dh>Crawford, who was older than Monroe, saw the rising star as a threat to her tumultuous career coupled with her drinking habits.

After Monroe rejected the fellow actress, Crawford became spiteful.</p><p class=dh>Sadly, Crawford outlived Monroe and continued to grace the screens with her acting. In 1977, she passed away from a heart attack. Both ladies left a legacy in Hollywood along with their notable acting performances.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmptaWlla3qpsdGeqmarpKS%2FunnBnqutsV2starAxGaZnpldlr%2B1tNSrqmahnpuub7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-golden-girls-stars-betty-white-and-bea-arthur-were-friends-on-screen-but-foes-in-reality.html&text=%27The%20Golden%20Girls%27%20Stars%20Betty%20White%20and%20Bea%20Arthur%20Were%20Friends%20on%20Screen%20but%20Foes%20in%20Reality&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-golden-girls-stars-betty-white-and-bea-arthur-were-friends-on-screen-but-foes-in-reality.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-golden-girls-stars-betty-white-and-bea-arthur-were-friends-on-screen-but-foes-in-reality.html&title=%27The%20Golden%20Girls%27%20Stars%20Betty%20White%20and%20Bea%20Arthur%20Were%20Friends%20on%20Screen%20but%20Foes%20in%20Reality" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-golden-girls-stars-betty-white-and-bea-arthur-were-friends-on-screen-but-foes-in-reality.html&title=%27The%20Golden%20Girls%27%20Stars%20Betty%20White%20and%20Bea%20Arthur%20Were%20Friends%20on%20Screen%20but%20Foes%20in%20Reality" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-golden-girls-stars-betty-white-and-bea-arthur-were-friends-on-screen-but-foes-in-reality.html&title=%27The%20Golden%20Girls%27%20Stars%20Betty%20White%20and%20Bea%20Arthur%20Were%20Friends%20on%20Screen%20but%20Foes%20in%20Reality" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-golden-girls-stars-betty-white-and-bea-arthur-were-friends-on-screen-but-foes-in-reality.html&description=%27The%20Golden%20Girls%27%20Stars%20Betty%20White%20and%20Bea%20Arthur%20Were%20Friends%20on%20Screen%20but%20Foes%20in%20Reality" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./candace-bushnell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Candace Bushnell">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./you-will-now-access-chatgpt-without-signing-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="You Will Now Access ChatGPT Without Signing Up">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
