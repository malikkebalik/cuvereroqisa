Jimmie was previously hailed as a promising star on the rise. But Allen is now embroiled in a scandal as his former manager has accused and sued him for sexual and physical assault. Though the singer has maintained his innocence, impending ruination might be on its way for Allen. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on June 18, 1985, in Milton, Delaware, Allen's ascent in the music industry is a pretty recent event. Jimmie was a jobbing singer, doing gigs for little money after an unfortunate economical situation and a failed audition on <i>American Idol</i>. He landed his first big hit with the release of his single, <i>Best Shot</i>, in 2018. &nbsp;</p><h3>Get to Know More About Jimmie Allen! &nbsp;</h3><p>Despite being tossed off <i>American Idol</i> in 2011, Allen found himself checking all of his bucket lists one after another. The Delaware native had penned down his specific career goals long before he set off to fulfill them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/12/322651932_1302130746997068_1841104729463372525_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683907710821.jpg><p>The to-do list included landing a publishing deal, signing a record deal, performing with legendary icons, etc. Allen checked the foremost box when he signed a publishing deal with <strong>Ash Bowers</strong>' Wide Open Music and later signed with BBR Music's <i>Stoney Creek</i> in 2017. &nbsp;</p><p>Allen showed immense potential with the release of his self-titled debut EP. He checked another box when his debut single, <i>Best Shot</i>, ranked #1 on Billboard's country airplay chart, making him the first Black artist to chart on top with the debut single.</p><h3>Jimmie&nbsp;and his road to success!</h3><p>Allen's sky-rocketing career expanded quickly as the singer started a management, production, and publishing company in Nashville. The Milton-born is so laser-focused on becoming the best that he once <a href=#>revealed</a> that he only gets three to four hours of sleep. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/12/344899030_257553239980698_2624912716687528758_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683907718486.jpg><p>Allen's young career has since spawned three albums, <i>Mercury Lane,</i> Bettie <i>James Gold Edition</i>, and <i>Tulip Drive,</i> which reflects the singer's tumultuous life before fame. Allen's <i>Tulip Drive</i> featured collaborations with <strong>Cee Lo Green, T-Pain</strong>, and <strong>Jennifer Lopez.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>Jimmie's consecutive hits earned him the ACM award for New Male Artist of the Year in 2021. Similarly, he bagged the coveted CMA awards in the same category and a Grammy nomination. Allen also launched his television career the same year, he competed on ABC's <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Jimmie Allen's Fall: Sued by Former Manager! &nbsp;</h3><p>The<i> Best Shot </i>hitmaker is in hot waters as his former manager, who is keeping her anonymity, and hence, going by Jane Doe, sued the singer for sexual assault and abuse. She goes as far as to accuse the country singer of rape. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/12/325468797_545474004304823_3556245259982119891_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683907727591.jpg><p>Jimmie's former manager's accusations against him in her court filing read "(he) raped her and repeatedly subjected her to sexual abuse and harassment over 18 months." The woman claims she was a virgin when Allen raped her during a work trip to Los Angeles. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Allen has been suspended from his label after the accusations!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The gruesome accusations against Allen have hit his career hard. Since journalist <strong>Elizabeth Wagmeister</strong> detailed the report <a href=#>on Variety</a>, Allen, 37, has been suspended by his label, BBR, kicked out as the commencement speaker at Delaware State University, and CMA fest line-up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/12/329359717_721616836327614_4333451266275962717_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683907883806.jpg><p>Allen's former management firm, Wide Open Music, has also been hit hard as the firm is also being sued for gross negligence and a few more counts. The Down Home crooner has since come forward to refute the accusations. Allen admits having a sexual relationship with Doe, but calls allegations "false and damaging." &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Jimmie Allen's Personal Life! &nbsp;</h3><p>The singer-songwriter, Jimmie Allen, is taking blows from every side. Allen was a married man and a mega-star-in-making just days ago.&nbsp;</p><p>But fast forward to this day, and Allen is not doing well in both domains. The singer's wife of two years, <strong>Alexis Gale</strong>, and him ended things last month. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/12/323737557_742618136788771_5878139432164953926_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683907752135.jpg><p>Jimmie and his ex-wife, Gale, share<a href=#> two kids,</a> daughters <strong>Zara James</strong>, 18 months, and <strong>Naomi Bettie</strong>, 3. Moreover, the ex-could is expecting a third one on its way.</p><p>The reason behind their split appears to be the lawsuit against the singer. Alexis recently posted a cryptic message on Instagram, pleading with fans to stop messaging her. &nbsp;</p><p>Gale also added, "Continue the chaos while I heal in peace."&nbsp;</p><p>The pair, who tied the knot in 2020, announced their separation on Instagram on April 21. The Grammy-nominated singer's <a href=#>statement</a> read that the estranged spouses are committed to co-parenting their kids. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqrtcymoJ5lkaG5prqMrZ%2BeZZOkwq%2FA0bJkrKGenLKzedahpmaho2KvprXNoGSsrZWZeqe70WaqnrCllrlurdKsmK6kpA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jimmie-allen-the-country-singer-who-is-being-sued-for-sexual-assault.html&text=Who%20is%20Jimmie%20Allen%3f%20The%20Country%20Singer%20Who%20is%20Being%20Sued%20For%20Sexual%20Assault&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jimmie-allen-the-country-singer-who-is-being-sued-for-sexual-assault.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jimmie-allen-the-country-singer-who-is-being-sued-for-sexual-assault.html&title=Who%20is%20Jimmie%20Allen%3f%20The%20Country%20Singer%20Who%20is%20Being%20Sued%20For%20Sexual%20Assault" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-jimmie-allen-the-country-singer-who-is-being-sued-for-sexual-assault.html&title=Who%20is%20Jimmie%20Allen%3f%20The%20Country%20Singer%20Who%20is%20Being%20Sued%20For%20Sexual%20Assault" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jimmie-allen-the-country-singer-who-is-being-sued-for-sexual-assault.html&title=Who%20is%20Jimmie%20Allen%3f%20The%20Country%20Singer%20Who%20is%20Being%20Sued%20For%20Sexual%20Assault" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jimmie-allen-the-country-singer-who-is-being-sued-for-sexual-assault.html&description=Who%20is%20Jimmie%20Allen%3f%20The%20Country%20Singer%20Who%20is%20Being%20Sued%20For%20Sexual%20Assault" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-was-brian-dequincey-newman-clifton-newman-son-judge-who-sentenced-alex-murdaugh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Was Brian DeQuincey Newman | Clifton Newman Son | Judge Who Sentenced Alex Murdaugh">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./net-worth-age-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Net Worth, Age &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
