Facts</span></h3><li><span>During his childhood, his father’s family moved to Kirovaul, where his father opened a gym on the ground floor of a two-story building.&nbsp;His interest in martial arts grew from watching his father train his students at the gym.</span></li><li><span>Khabib started wrestling at the age of 8.&nbsp;He was coached by his father, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, who was an army veteran and former distinguished athlete.&nbsp;During his time in the military, he learned sambo and judo.</span></li><li><span>When he turned 9, his father forced him to fight a bear to improve his wrestling skills.</span></li><li><span>He began his judo training at the age of 15 and when he turned 17 he began training in combat sambo under the tutelage of his father.</span></li><li><span>In his youth he often got into street fights.&nbsp;However, that all changed when he focused full-time on his mixed martial arts training.</span></li><li><span>In late 2011, Khabib signed a six-fight contract with UFC to compete in the popular promotion’s lightweight division.</span></li><li><span>In his fight against Abel Trujillo at&nbsp;</span><span>UFC 160</span><span>&nbsp;in May 2013, he set a record for most takedowns in UFC when he managed to successfully complete 21 takedowns from 27 attempts.</span></li><li><span>However, his fight against Trujillo was shrouded in complications, as he weighed in at 158.5lbs, which was 2½ pounds over the allowable light fight limit.&nbsp;He agreed to give away a percentage of his fight money to his opponent and ratify the fight to a catchweight bout.</span></li><li><span>In December 2017, he won his first&nbsp;</span><span>performance of the night</span><span>&nbsp;bonus after managing to dominate Edson Barboza over 3 rounds at&nbsp;</span><span>UFC 219</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;He had won the match unanimously.</span></li><li><span>In April 2018, he became the&nbsp;</span><span>UFC Lightweight Champion</span><span>&nbsp;when he defeated Al Iaquinta by a unanimous decision at&nbsp;</span><span>UFC 223</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></li><li><span>With his win at&nbsp;</span><span>UFC 223</span><span>&nbsp;he became the first Russian fighter to win the UFC title.</span></li><li><span>He faced Conor McGregor opposite&nbsp;</span><span>UFC 229</span><span>&nbsp;in August 2018 when he made his first defense of his title.&nbsp;He managed to beat and dominate the popular Irish fighter and won the match in the 4th round via submission.</span></li><li><span>After his impressive win over McGregor, he ended up in hot water with UFC as he leaped out of the octagon to face off with the opposing team, leading to a major brawl.</span></li><li><span>With his victory over McGregor, he managed to extend his impressive unbeaten record in MMA to a total of 27 fights.&nbsp;He had won 9 of his games via assist while another 8 wins came by knockouts.</span></li><li><span>In 2016, he co-founded the mixed martial arts team,&nbsp;</span><span>Eagles MMA team</span><span>&nbsp;, alongside Ziyavudin Magomedov.</span></li><li><span>Follow Khabib Nurmagomedov on Facebook, Twitter and
