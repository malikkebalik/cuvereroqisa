The <a href=# rel>South Carolina</a> native, 22, shared the haunting post on Facebook just a few hours before he went missing.&nbsp;</p><p>The father of one reshared a post&nbsp;from musician David Adam Byrnes that read "Them: 'Don't play any sad songs,'" followed by "Me:" along with an image of legendary country singer <a href=# rel>George Jones</a>. Doyle's post seemed to point to the fact that he would still like to prefer sad songs, especially those made iconic by Jones. Viewers and online sleuths quickly took to the comments to discuss the current scenario and whereabouts of Doyle despite the seemingly light-hearted tone of the original post.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Tina Shaw?

After raising more than $31,000, it was taken down due to entirely due to "drama and rumors." Lakelyn requested people to stop donating on February 4.</p><p>"Thanks to everyone who has donated. It is greatly appreciated. Due to the rumors and everything going around, his wife, Lakelyn, wants me to stop all donations to this go fund me," Faulk wrote, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun</a>. "She rather go without, then to deal with drama and rumors while she’s actively searching for her missing husband. The search for Tyler is still on going," she added.</p><p>Hannah continued, "Thanks again for all the donations, but as a woman 30 weeks pregnant she can’t handle everyone’s opinion and stress on her body for the baby’s sake." Doyle's brother previously revealed that his sibling and a friend went for ducking but they came across a problem. Doyle was said to have fallen from his boat after it began to take on water.</p><p>“The waves got up and out there; it changes really quick, and the back of the boat took on water," Reed said, adding, "Waves took over the back of the boat and took Tyler with it."</p><h2 class=split>Search for Doyle continues</h2><p>On Saturday, February 4, the North Myrtle Beach Rescue Squad announced that it had suspended its search for Doyle. "It is with a heavy heart that, at this time, we are suspending the daily searches," a representative stated, adding, "Our crews are exhausted and need to return to their families and jobs."</p><p>However, Reed claimed that the search will continue as he pleaded for support from the community. He also urged his followers on TikTok to stop spreading rumors online without knowing the actual fact. "Tyler Doyle was my brother," he said, adding, "We have been out here for 10 days looking. "Everybody's searching, you know, and we're trying to figure everything out."&nbsp;</p><p>He asked to stop spreading misinformation about the incident as it is affecting the lives of him and Doyle's family. "The people out here that are keyboard warriors and wanting to talk s**t over&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;and just want to piece things together as they see it, you know you guys are not helping the cause," he warned.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorKmhsrN5w6iwpZ1dmcKkt4yhrKeslad6c36MrJ%2BaqpWZeqmt1KeroqaXYr2wv9NmmJunpal6sbjAsqCnn12orqV50qiloKtdqbWmecOasGaglWKxqr%2FAqaeemaKasQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftyler-doyle-duck-hunter-22-shared-haunting-post-about-playing-sad-songs-the-day-he-disappeared.html&text=Tyler%20Doyle%3a%20Duck%20hunter%2c%2022%2c%20shared%20haunting%20post%20about%20playing%20sad%20songs%20the%20day%20he%20disappeared&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftyler-doyle-duck-hunter-22-shared-haunting-post-about-playing-sad-songs-the-day-he-disappeared.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftyler-doyle-duck-hunter-22-shared-haunting-post-about-playing-sad-songs-the-day-he-disappeared.html&title=Tyler%20Doyle%3a%20Duck%20hunter%2c%2022%2c%20shared%20haunting%20post%20about%20playing%20sad%20songs%20the%20day%20he%20disappeared" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftyler-doyle-duck-hunter-22-shared-haunting-post-about-playing-sad-songs-the-day-he-disappeared.html&title=Tyler%20Doyle%3a%20Duck%20hunter%2c%2022%2c%20shared%20haunting%20post%20about%20playing%20sad%20songs%20the%20day%20he%20disappeared" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftyler-doyle-duck-hunter-22-shared-haunting-post-about-playing-sad-songs-the-day-he-disappeared.html&title=Tyler%20Doyle%3a%20Duck%20hunter%2c%2022%2c%20shared%20haunting%20post%20about%20playing%20sad%20songs%20the%20day%20he%20disappeared" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftyler-doyle-duck-hunter-22-shared-haunting-post-about-playing-sad-songs-the-day-he-disappeared.html&description=Tyler%20Doyle%3a%20Duck%20hunter%2c%2022%2c%20shared%20haunting%20post%20about%20playing%20sad%20songs%20the%20day%20he%20disappeared" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-erin-lichy-meet-the-interior-designer-on-rhony-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Erin Lichy?
