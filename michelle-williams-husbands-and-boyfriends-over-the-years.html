With a career repertoire as stellar as any of her male contemporaries, including her former co-star <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>, Williams is a certified powerhouse in Hollywood. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on September 9, 1980, in Kalispell, Montana, a few in history have been as sure, and courageous as Williams, who, at 15, filed for emancipation from her parents so that she could focus on her acting career without breaking the child labor law. The actress, 42, today is also an ardent advocate for various social issues, including sexism, the gender pay gap, and more. &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Michelle Williams's Romantic History!&nbsp;</h3><p>Alongside her illustrious acting career, Michelle has also been navigating a high-profile personal life. The Oscar-nominated actress's associations with some A-list stars have constantly brought her attention, often overwhelming, and inundated. Michelle wasn't the magnificent movie star that she is today when she started dating <strong>Jeremy Jackson</strong> in the 90s. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/2/333681387_630704322199133_7651557346067282631_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690951082941.jpg><p>Williams' relationship with Jeremy, which reportedly lasted two years, was so under-covered that the press only discovered it when Jackson made the news public knowledge in 2011. The <i>Blue Valentine </i>actress famously dated her <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> co-star, <strong>Heath Ledger.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>Michelle and Ledger's relationship transpired to be a hasty one, with the pair announcing their engagement, and first pregnancy after months of dating. The tabloid's favorite couple welcomed their first child, <a href=#>Matilda Ledger</a>, in October 2005, and called it quits after two years in 2007- just months before Ledger's tragic passing at the age of 28. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/2/323741948_561283082575041_9184791524557235992_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690951089299.jpg><p>Michelle became the subject of massive media scrutiny following the death of Ledger. Some even assumed the actress's role in the Oscar winner's demise. Overwhelmed by the perpetual media attention, Williams moved to upstate New York in search of a quieter life. &nbsp;</p><p>In the years following Heath's death, Williams was linked with directors <strong>Spike Jonze</strong> and <strong>Cary Joji Fukunaga</strong>, actor<strong> Jason Segel</strong>, and artist <strong>Dustin Yellin</strong>. The five-time Oscar-nominated actress was briefly engaged to financier <strong>Andrew Youmans </strong>in 2018. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/2/280272238_308260811503632_9207635883716729745_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690951097387.jpg><p>Michelle surprised the world in July 2018 when she revealed that she had secretly tied the knot with musician <strong>Phil Elverum,</strong> who was a widower after his first wife <strong>GeneviÃ¨ve CastrÃ©e,</strong> died in 2016. The couple reportedly said their vows in a private ceremony in the Adirondack Mountains in July 2018. But the notoriously private couple's marriage ended as swiftly as it had started. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Williams co-parented her daughter, Matilda, with Oscar-winner Heath Ledger until his death in 2007!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p><i>The Fabelsman </i>actress and her musician husband had called it quits by April 2019. Although the reason behind their split was never revealed, Williams spoke highly of Elverum during their time together. "I'm finally loved by someone who makes me feel free," the actress had<a href=#> said.</a> &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Michelle Williams' Second Conjugal Life with Thomas Kail! &nbsp; &nbsp;</h3><p>After weathering intense media scrutiny and speculations in the past, Williams has learned her lesson to keep it quiet, and private. The acclaimed actress is going strong with her second husband, <strong>Thomas Kail,</strong> a theatre director. Williams and Kail's relationship has also been a whirlwind affair. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/2/87326941_198282494592813_838588797646784304_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690951103583.jpg><p>The Montana-born actress met Kail when she played the legendary dancer <strong>Gwen Verdon</strong> in Thomas's directorial, <i>Fosse/Verdon</i>, in late 2018. And before fans and media could witness the duo slowly translate their relationship into real life, Williams and Kail had already been married. The pair reportedly got hitched in March 2020; a year after Thomas divorced his first wife, actress <strong>Angela Christian.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The low-key couple welcomed their firstborn, Williams' second, son <strong>Hart</strong>, in June 2020. The twosome became a family of five when the <i>Shutter Island </i>actress gave birth to a baby, whose name is kept discreet at the moment, in late 2022. "There's nothing that makes you committed to a better world than raising a great kid. It's the ultimate creative act," the actress said about motherhood. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/2/126916580_191042072653457_4142493937978175341_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690951111392.jpg><p>Michelle's lesser-known husband, Kail, 45, is an acclaimed theatre director. Thomas is best known for his working closely with<strong> Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong> in the <i>Heights</i> and <i>Hamilton.</i> A Tony-winning director, Kail's notable credits also include <i>Grease Live, Tiny Beautiful Things,</i> and <i>Magic/Bird</i>. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqagnKCVobmmedaio6WhkaLAbrTUrJmappSoeqK6w2aZqLGWp7amusOsZKiulad6tbTEZrCemaKo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html&text=Michelle%20Williams%27%20Husbands%20and%20Boyfriends%20Over%20the%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html&title=Michelle%20Williams%27%20Husbands%20and%20Boyfriends%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html&title=Michelle%20Williams%27%20Husbands%20and%20Boyfriends%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html&title=Michelle%20Williams%27%20Husbands%20and%20Boyfriends%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichelle-williams-husbands-and-boyfriends-over-the-years.html&description=Michelle%20Williams%27%20Husbands%20and%20Boyfriends%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ryder-wright-all-you-need-to-know-about-saddle-bronc-bull-rider-winner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryder Wright: All you need to know about Saddle Bronc Bull Rider winner!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./meet-jermaine-jakes-the-second-son-of-bishop-t-d-jakes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Jermaine Jakes, The Second Son of Bishop T.D.
