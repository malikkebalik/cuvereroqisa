In November 2002, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brandi-carlile-grammys-2019-speech_n_5c60df82e4b0eec79b24fb0a>identified as a lesbian</a>.</p><p class=dh>Eventually, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a30655706/brandi-carlile-wife-catherine-shepherd/>Carlile met Catherine Shepherd</a> when the latter contacted the former to donate some of Paul McCartney’s memorabilia to Carlile’s initiative Fight the Fear (Shepherd coordinated Paul McCartney’s charity work for a decade).</p><p class=dh>Carlile once admitted that she and her partner met through their interest in charity and that, for about a year, she thought she was talking to a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/brandi-carlile-charity-philanthropy-824855/>65-year-old person</a>, so it was an “interesting way to fall in love.”</p><p class=dh>Almost a year after they first started talking to each other, Shepherd, who lived in the UK at the time, went to New York City. At one of Carlile’s shows, they finally <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a30655706/brandi-carlile-wife-catherine-shepherd/>met in person</a>. The rest was history.</p><p class=dh>In 2012, Brandi Carlile and Catherine Shepherd <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://tasteofcountry.com/brandi-carlile-the-mother/>tied the knot</a>. Nowadays, they share two daughters, two-year-old Elijah and six-year-old Evangeline.</p><p class=dh>Earlier this year, the singer-songwriter made some headlines after writing an essay for <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.parents.com/parenting/celebrity-parents/brandi-carlile-on-her-journey-to-lgbtq-parenting-queers-must-pave-their-own-way/>Parents</a> magazine about queer parenting, making clear that it “lacks a manual.”</p><p class=dh>Carlile admitted she wished there had been more information available for her to read or “absentmindedly absorb through TV sitcoms, movies, and ads.”</p><p class=dh>That way, she would have been better prepared for “the strangeness” of caring for a child without much representation or mirror that successfully showed her what that would look like.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HAVING EVANGELINE</strong></p><p class=dh>In the essay, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.parents.com/parenting/celebrity-parents/brandi-carlile-on-her-journey-to-lgbtq-parenting-queers-must-pave-their-own-way/>Carlile wrote</a> that the couple opted for In-Vitro Fertilization to have Evangeline. They harvested Carlile’s eggs, which Shepherd carried. For both women, the experience was “really complicated.”</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>They had developed different but complementary baby skills and were ready for Elijah’s arrival.</strong></h3><p class=dh>According to Carlile, she didn’t know “who” she was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/brandi-carlile-wife-daughters-essay-parents-magazine/>supposed to be</a> as she was not pregnant but knew for sure she wasn’t “dad” either. Shepherd, on the other hand, was uncomfortable with everything happening to her body.</p><p class=dh>Brandi Carlile admitted that the entire concept felt “foreign” to them and that she didn’t know how to fit in during birthing classes. Eventually, they found an LGBTQ+-sensitive instructor.</p><p class=dh>Through them, the couple could navigate and identify their parental inclinations together. Apart from that, Carlile and Shepherd have been learning about themselves through their daughters.
