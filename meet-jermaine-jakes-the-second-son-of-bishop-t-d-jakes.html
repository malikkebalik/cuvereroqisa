He is an American national born under the Capricorn birth sign and is of mixed ethnicity.</p><p>The data analyst was born to Bishop T.D. Jakes and Serita Jakes. Jermaine is the second child out of the four children born to the couple. His siblings – Jamar Jakes, Sarah Jakes Roberts, and Cora Jakes, have contributed immensely to the work of the ministry. They all grew up under the care of their parents, who ensured that they were raised and rooted in Christ.</p><p>Jakes’s son attended Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Magnet Centre High School, where he majored in Education and Social Service. According to his <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>, he had some college experience but did not mention the college that he attended or if he graduated.</p><h2><strong>Who Are Jermaine Jakes’s Parents?</strong></h2><p>Jermaine Jakes only gained recognition for being the second son of Bishop T.D. Jakes, an American non-denominational Christian preacher and senior pastor of The Potter’s House. He is also an author who has credits for many Christian and motivational books, including TD Jakes Speaks to Men, Overcoming the Enemy, From the Cross to Pentecost, and more.</p><p>The preacher also has some discography credits and has appeared in some movies and produced many of them.</p><p>Jermaine’s mother, Serita Jakes, is also a minister of the gospel and has authored a good number of books. The data analyst’s parents met way back when Bishop T.D. Jakes hadn’t gained fame as a preacher. The duo met at Sarita’s home church in West Virginia, where T.D. Jakes visited as a guest preacher. They were captivated by each other’s uniqueness and began dating afterward.</p><p>Before their wedding, they welcomed their first son in 1979; by 1980, they welcomed Jermaine. Two years after they welcomed the data analyst, they got married and have stood the test of time, with their marriage spanning 41 years and counting. Meanwhile, after some years, Jermaine Jake’s father’s ministry began flourishing, and today, he is well-known all over the world.</p><h2><strong>Why was Jermaine Jakes Arrested?</strong></h2><p>On January 3, 2009, at about 10:00 p.m., Jermaine Jakes was detained and released at the same point. The data analyst had previously been accused of exposing himself in front of two undercover Dallas police vice investigators at Kiest Park, which is located close to West Kiest Boulevard and South Hampton Road.</p><p>According to sources, it was reported to the authorities following the illegal sexual activities going on there. Jermaine Jakes walked into the wooded area, unknown to him, that the detectives were watching and spent a couple of minutes there. After he came out, he made his way to one of the detectives and began to masturbate while keeping eye contact with him. The data analyst was arrested on the spot and was later released at that same place.</p><p>After his release, his defense attorney, Faith Johnson, revealed that they were aware of the potential allegations involving her client and were undertaking their own investigations. On February 12, 2009, Dallas County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Kimberlee Leach made it known that Jermaine Jakes turned himself in earlier that day. He reportedly turned himself in at a local jail, but the exact place is not known.</p><p>Meanwhile, his offense was considered a Class B misdemeanor, which was punishable with a $2 thousand fine or a six-month jail term. He was later released on a $1,000 bond paid by his father. After this, he was released by the judge on a personal recognizance bond.</p><h2><strong>Is Bishop T.D. Jakes’s Second Son Married?</strong></h2><p>Though Jermaine Jakes has had his own share of publicity by being related to Bishop T.D. Jakes and his run-in with the authority, he currently maintains a low profile. The data analyst has remained reserved about revealing details of his personal life, thereby making information about whether he is married or not unavailable. There are also no details of his past relationships or if he is currently dating anyone.</p><h2><strong>Jermaine Jakes’s Siblings are Active in The Ministry</strong></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Jermaine Jakes is the second out of the four children born to his parents. Jermaine has two younger sisters and an older brother. Here is more about his siblings.</p><h3><strong>Jamar Jakes</strong></h3><p>Jamar Jakes is the oldest sibling of Jermaine Jakes, born on January 4, 1979, in Texas, the United States. He maintains a low profile, and as such, much about him is not known. However, because he was raised in a Christian family, he has grown to become an adept worker in the church. Jamar began working as the director of his father’s business and other ventures before becoming The Potter House’s general manager.</p><h3><strong>Sarah Jakes Roberts</strong></h3><p>Sarah Jakes Roberts is the younger sibling of Jermaine Jakes, born on July 17, 1988, in Texas, the United States. She has had her fair share of teenage challenges, which she overcame to become the accomplished woman that she is today. Sarah is a writer, speaker, businesswoman, and media personality who is the senior editor of the online magazine eMotions.</p><p>Jermaines’s sister has been extensively involved in the work of the ministry and founded the Woman Evolve ministry. She is also a co-pastor at the Potter’s House in Los Angeles and Denver. Apart from her presence in churches, she also reaches out to people through the numerous Christian and motivational books that she has authored.</p><p>Sarah is also a mother to her five children, whom she has welcomed from her present and past marriages. She got married to Robert Henson in 2008 and divorced him after welcoming a child with him. In 2014, she got married to Touré Roberts, with whom she had four kids, and they have been blissfully married to date.</p><h3><strong>Cora Jakes Coleman</strong></h3><p>Cora Jakes Coleman is Jermaine Jakes’s youngest sibling, born on July 19, 1987, in the United States. As much as she tries to maintain a low profile, there are still things to be known about her. She is a motivational speaker, social media influencer, spiritual advisor, pastor, and author who works in the child ministry of The Potter’s House in Dallas.</p><p>Cora is the mother of two children whom she adopted due to fertility challenges. She is married to Larissa Piao, whom she married in 2020. However, their marriage is about to hit a rock as she filed for divorce from her husband after he was charged with child abuse.</p><h2><strong>What Does Bishop T.D Jakes’s Second Son Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>Jermaine Jakes is not left out of the work of the ministry, as he contributes to it in his own way. Prior to his work in the ministry, he worked for various bodies as an artist and recruiter development at Dexterity Sounds Inc., an intake referral coordinator at the Texas Offenders Re-Entry initiative, a stage manager at Vanessa Goodrich Productions, and more. He began working at The Potter’s House Church as an audio-visual technician in 2007 and has so far held various positions in the church.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/jakes.jpg alt width=696 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Jermaine has served in the church as a customer care representative, production manager, production coordinator, lead stage manager, and production specialist.
