The show which has been executive produced by Holly Madison, a former Playboy model and ex-girlfriend of the magazine's founder, <a href=#>Hugh Hefner</a> is all set to premiere on January 23 on ID and will be available on Discovery+, the same day.</p><p>While discussing the show with <a href=# rel=nofollow>ET</a>, Madison had mentioned the names of some models who will be the focus of the episodes. One of the names was Christina Carlin-Kraft, a former Playboy model, who was strangled to death when she refused to pay for an ounce of cocaine.&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Madison</a> said that each part of the series is about a different murder that somehow involved someone linked to the Playboy world. Madison said, "I think these stories are really important stories to tell," while noting that not all of them have been covered before.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Echo Butler: Pennsylvania woman sentenced to life for helping GF starve her daughters, 6 and 4, to death</a></p><p><a href=# rel>The Duggars' dirty secrets: Jinger Duggar opens up about 'terrifying and cult-like' childhood</a></p><p>Madison also believes that Hefner "would have wanted people to know about the truth of what happened".

Harris was found guilty of first-degree murder on May 9, 2019, as reported by the <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Post</a>. Carlin-Kraft's body was found in bed with the bones in her face broken and significant bruising, officials said. An autopsy reportedly determined she died from strangulation and there were no illegal substances in her body.</p><p>Harris had pleaded not guilty to the murder charges though authorities said he described to them the gruesome details of how he battered the model. According to the <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Post</a>, Harris allegedly told authorities he and Carlin-Kraft had consensual sex on August 22 before a violent fight broke out when she refused to pay him for the drugs. The defense claimed that Harris was “high out of his mind” on ketamine when he strangled Carlin-Kraft and that he never meant to kill her.</p><p>But the prosecution claimed that Harris' version of events “makes no sense.” “His story was that it was over cocaine, but given the circumstances around this murder, it makes no sense that this was about drugs,” Assistant District Attorney Roderick Fancher told jurors. “Was it over sex? Was it over money? We won’t know, because the only person who did know was killed in that bedroom that night.”</p><p>Harris told detectives that he "slapped her in the face and she fell to the floor.” In statements to authorities, Harris claimed he carried the model to her bed and bound her hands so she couldn’t strike him. He then allegedly punched her again in the face when she wouldn’t give him the money for the drugs. Harris told the cops he “began choking her” when she tried to call 911. “I panicked. I was scared. I didn’t know what to do,” he told authorities. The accused killer admitted he fled the blood-splattered scene through a back door, and then jumped from the balcony.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJiaerG4wLKZqLFdosKzsMSrqmasmJp6tbvRrayrnV2Wu6V5yqKjpaGenHqwsoycn6uho6m2r62MnJirpJmjeqy%2BwJ%2Br</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-playboy-murders-the-torture-and-killing-of-christina-carlin-kraft.html&text=%27The%20Playboy%20Murders%27%3a%20The%20torture%20and%20killing%20of%20Christina%20Carlin-Kraft&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-playboy-murders-the-torture-and-killing-of-christina-carlin-kraft.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-playboy-murders-the-torture-and-killing-of-christina-carlin-kraft.html&title=%27The%20Playboy%20Murders%27%3a%20The%20torture%20and%20killing%20of%20Christina%20Carlin-Kraft" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-playboy-murders-the-torture-and-killing-of-christina-carlin-kraft.html&title=%27The%20Playboy%20Murders%27%3a%20The%20torture%20and%20killing%20of%20Christina%20Carlin-Kraft" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-playboy-murders-the-torture-and-killing-of-christina-carlin-kraft.html&title=%27The%20Playboy%20Murders%27%3a%20The%20torture%20and%20killing%20of%20Christina%20Carlin-Kraft" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-playboy-murders-the-torture-and-killing-of-christina-carlin-kraft.html&description=%27The%20Playboy%20Murders%27%3a%20The%20torture%20and%20killing%20of%20Christina%20Carlin-Kraft" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./anna-bosma-22-year-old-women-from-sioux-falls-south-dakota-dies-in-accident-near-uno-campus.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anna Bosma, 22-year-old women, from Sioux Falls, South Dakota dies in accident near UNO campus">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-tammy-collins-kirk-franklin-s-wife-slammed-for-laughing-in-viral-audio-of-him-abusing-son-ke.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Tammy Collins?
