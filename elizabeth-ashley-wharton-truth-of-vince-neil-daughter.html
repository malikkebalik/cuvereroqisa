She is the daughter of Vince Neil and Beth Lynn, his first wife.</p><p>Elizabeth, 38, is of Caucasian origin and possesses an American nationality. However, knowledge about her early life and education is a little hazy.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Between_Elizabeth_Ashley_Wharton8217s_Parents>Relationship Between Elizabeth Ashley Wharton’s Parents</span></h2><p>Her father, Neil, a native of California, married Beth Lynn in 1981. The next year, Vince became the lead vocalist for the heavy metal band Motley Crue. In 1981, he secured his first recording job with the band, who released their debut album Too Fast for Love.</p><p>In the years since, the musician has collaborated with the group on a number of hard-hitting albums and singles. Despite his enormous success in music, Neil’s marriage to Beth did not last long.</p><p>However, after four years of marriage, the couple divorced in 1985. Elle spent the majority of her time with her mother after their divorce, but she also saw her father on occasion.</p><p>Lynn is living a low-key existence after her divorce from Neil.</p><h2><span id=Elizabeth_has_how_many_siblings_Her_sister_passed_away_from_cancer>Elizabeth has how many siblings?

He has likewise been following in the footsteps of his father. He fronts his own Crue tribute band, Rock ‘n’ Roll Junkkies, together with guitarist Steven Talbott, bassist Matty Vincent, and drummer Patrick Labuda.</p><p>Neil described his half-sister as “really, really smart” to Chronological Crue. Every day, she reads a book.”</p><p>Wharton had a sister named Skylar Lynnae Neil from her father’s second marriage to fashion model Sharise Ruddell. Vince and Sharise married in April 1987 and welcomed their daughter on March 26, 1991.</p><p>Skylar, Elle’s younger sister, died on August 15, 1995, at the age of four. Following her unexpected death, her father Neil established the Skylar Neil Memorial Fund. Its goal is to raise awareness in order to protect children from numerous ailments. The foundation has also raised millions of dollars, with a large amount of the proceeds going to The T.J. Martell Foundation.</p><h2><span id=Elizabeth_has_two_half-siblings>Elizabeth has two half-siblings.</span></h2><p>Tess and Lainy are Elle’s half-sisters. Will, her husband, once shared a photo of three sisters on Instagram.</p><p>However, it has not been established if the two are from Elle’s mother’s or her father’s connection.</p><h2><span id=Two_More_Failed_Marriages_of_Father_Vince_Neil>Two More Failed Marriages of Father Vince Neil</span></h2><p>Back in the early 1990s, Vince Neil was romantically related to actress and Playboy Playmate Heidi Mark. The couple began dating in 1993 after meeting on a blind date set up by Heidi’s cosmetics artist.</p><p>After a few months of dating, the pair became engaged and married in 2000. Neil’s marriage to Mark, on the other hand, terminated in divorce in 2001.</p><p>Vince married Lia for the fourth time in January 2005. After five years of marriage, the couple divorced in 2010.</p><p>He married four times, but none of his marriages endured the test of time.

Elysium Productions, a videography company, was also present at the wedding.</p><p>The lovebirds share a passion for music and have made a successful career in it.

Will Wharton, Elizabeth Ashley Wharton’s husband, uploaded a snapshot of the couple on Instagram on January 1, 2020, to commemorate their tenth anniversary.</p><p>The message made it plain that the couple had been together for years before getting married.</p><h2><span id=Do_They_Have_Any_Children>Do They Have Any Children?</span></h2><p>Elle and her life partner Will have been married for over a decade but have yet to have children. Elizabeth, on the other hand, is the proud aunt of two children, nephew Trace and niece Hailee Marie, born of her half-brother Neil’s marriage to Marie Wharton.</p><h2><span id=Elizabeth_Ashley_Wharton_works_as_a_bassist_in_her_husband_Will8217s_band>Elizabeth Ashley Wharton works as a bassist in her husband Will’s band.</span></h2><p>Wharton picked the same root because of her musician father’s influence.
