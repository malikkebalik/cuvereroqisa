The news of Meatball’s sudden death has spread throughout many communities, particularly in the circles of Oklahoma Cowboy Camp and Camp WOW, where he spent several years of his life. His sudden departure has left a vacuum in the hearts of all who knew him.</p><p>Hayden Stanley’s legacy is one of unwavering faith, selfless service, and a boundless love for the Lord. Abby Cruz, a close friend, announced the heartbreaking news on Thursday, expressing the sentiment shared by many: “Heaven has gained another angel. Hayden Stanley (Meatball), your love for the Lord and the kindness in your heart was and still is life-changing. You will be missed, fly high buddy.”</p><p>Meatball’s impact reached far and wide, evident in the outpouring of grief and tributes flooding social media platforms. The SWCC Youth Facebook group, in a heartfelt message, stated, “If you knew him, you loved him. With great sadness, Hayden Stanley ‘Meatball’ was tragically taken to his eternal home. Although he is more ALIVE now than he ever was here, we miss him and pray for peace for his family.”</p><p>Meatball’s involvement in the Camp WOW community, particularly as a Wrangler at CowCamp, touched the lives of countless individuals. The AFCC Oklahoma Cowboy Camp Facebook page reflected on his dedicated service, sharing, “It is with heavy hearts that we have to inform you that one of our own has gone on to be with Jesus. Hayden Stanley, known as ‘Meatball,’ served our Oklahoma Cow Camp as a wrangler for 5 years. In those 5 years, we watched an outgoing young man find his calling in being a servant for Christ.”</p><p>Meatball’s journey at Cowboy Camp wasn’t just about horsemanship; it was a transformative experience where he discovered his purpose and shared the message of Christ with boldness and passion. The post continued, “Countless students that came to Cow Camp saw the characteristics of Christ on display through Meatball. As we mourn the loss of our friend, we can’t help but remember the lives that were changed by the boldness and obedience that Meatball lived by in telling others about his Savior.”</p><p>The impact of Meatball’s life extends beyond the camps and into the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to know him personally. The call to prayer for the Stanley family, friends, camp family, and campers in the AFCC Oklahoma Cowboy Camp Facebook post highlights the deep sense of loss that is felt by the entire community. It is a testament to Meatball’s ability to forge genuine connections and leave an indelible mark on the lives he touched.</p><p>The post also encourages individuals to share pictures and memories of Meatball, emphasizing the desire to celebrate the profound impact he had on the Kingdom. This call to celebrate his life reflects the resilience of the community, choosing to focus on the positive and uplifting moments shared with Meatball rather than succumbing entirely to grief.</p><p>As we reflect on the life of Hayden Stanley, “Meatball,” we remember a man who lived his life with purpose, spreading the message of love, faith, and service. His legacy lives on in the countless lives he touched and the memories shared by those who were fortunate enough to know him. In this time of mourning, the communities of Camp WOW and Oklahoma Cowboy Camp come together, finding solace in their shared grief and celebrating the life of a remarkable individual who dedicated himself to serving the Kingdom. Meatball, though gone from this earthly realm, will forever remain alive in the hearts and memories of those who were blessed to know him. Until we see you again, Meatball, thank you for your unwavering dedication and the profound impact you’ve had on us all. Fly high, buddy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkaq0qq3OrKZyZZKZe6aw1Getp2eYlsalsc1mqq2ZnqGyunnMnpitmpGhuW67waKrrpmirnqotcumnKtlpK16p7vRppyrZZOWurF51qiuZquklrOnecOinJ1lmaN6rrvTqKmcsZOhsm6twpygnZ2eqXquscyoqaKZnGK1osLEp2Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhayden-stanley-meatball-obituary-gilmer-tx-former-camp-wow-staff-died-in-motorcycle-acci.html&text=Hayden%20Stanley%20Meatball%20Obituary%2c%20Gilmer%20TX%2c%20former%20Camp%20WOW%20Staff%20died%20in%20motorcycle%20acci&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhayden-stanley-meatball-obituary-gilmer-tx-former-camp-wow-staff-died-in-motorcycle-acci.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhayden-stanley-meatball-obituary-gilmer-tx-former-camp-wow-staff-died-in-motorcycle-acci.html&title=Hayden%20Stanley%20Meatball%20Obituary%2c%20Gilmer%20TX%2c%20former%20Camp%20WOW%20Staff%20died%20in%20motorcycle%20acci" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhayden-stanley-meatball-obituary-gilmer-tx-former-camp-wow-staff-died-in-motorcycle-acci.html&title=Hayden%20Stanley%20Meatball%20Obituary%2c%20Gilmer%20TX%2c%20former%20Camp%20WOW%20Staff%20died%20in%20motorcycle%20acci" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhayden-stanley-meatball-obituary-gilmer-tx-former-camp-wow-staff-died-in-motorcycle-acci.html&title=Hayden%20Stanley%20Meatball%20Obituary%2c%20Gilmer%20TX%2c%20former%20Camp%20WOW%20Staff%20died%20in%20motorcycle%20acci" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhayden-stanley-meatball-obituary-gilmer-tx-former-camp-wow-staff-died-in-motorcycle-acci.html&description=Hayden%20Stanley%20Meatball%20Obituary%2c%20Gilmer%20TX%2c%20former%20Camp%20WOW%20Staff%20died%20in%20motorcycle%20acci" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-zooey-deschanel-re-married-after-divorce-with-husband-jacob-pechenik.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Zooey Deschanel Re-Married After Divorce With Husband Jacob Pechenik?
