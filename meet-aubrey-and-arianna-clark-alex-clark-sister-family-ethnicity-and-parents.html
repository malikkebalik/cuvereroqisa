In his animated video, which was posted in 2018, he claimed that his sister is not evil and way more sweet in real life.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Aubrey may have poked him a little and pranked him during their childhood days, they get along just fine as adults. Moreover, she has never harmed him in any way.&nbsp;</p><p>Fun fact: As she is portrayed as the evil sister in Alex’s animations and cartoons, this made a few of her assistants fearful of her.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Apart from this, the YouTuber hasn’t talked much about his other sister, Arianna Clark.
