When the former alliance came up, Fat Trel broke down how it came together — and how it all eventually fell apart.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Trel first explained how he got a call out of nowhere from Master P one day in 2012, asking him to be in a Menace II Society sequel he was planning to make as he was attempting to purchase the rights. P added that he wanted to bring rapper (and future Louie V Mob member) Alley Boy into the film conversation as well, and that he’d fly both Alley Boy and Trel out to Los Angeles for it.</p><p>Two weeks later they all met in LA, and after talking about the movie, Master P asked Trel to move there.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“[P] was like, ‘I’ma need you to move out here.’ So I’m looking at my manager like, ‘What?’ He was like, ‘Yeah you know, just like a year or two.’ I’m like, ‘Aight!’ And I’m young, man. I’m like 22, 23 at the time. I don’t know nothing about the cost of living. All that shit, grown up shit ain’t even in my mind. So I’m like whatever.</p><p>“He was like, ‘I’m gonna give you x amount of dollars a month,'” Trel continued. “I’m like, “Okay, cool!” But when I moved there bro, the movie never got brought up.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Instead, they kept meeting at the studio and making music.</p><p>“Alley Boy was really cool with the situation and I felt like we was recording too much music because I’m like, we here for the movie, bruh,” Trel said. “I been living here for about seven months, I haven’t started a acting class, we no longer spoke about the scripts, the movie never ever came up. You know we doing video shoots and photo shoots and we got shirts pressed up that say Louie V Mob and he calling us the Louie V Mob and outside of the money that he was paying me monthly, I was receiving nothing for all of the music I’m putting out!”</p><p>He added: “The last straw was that [my boy] Black and them showed me that one of those [Louie V Mob] albums was on iTunes. This was before Apple Music and Spotify and all that. Like, the album was for sale on iTunes.”</p><p></p><p>When an unnamed Pro Era member died, Trel went to New York for the funeral and decided not to return to LA – leaving all of his belongings behind.</p><p>“I was looking for a deal or a large lump sum of money where I could take care of my family and be put into a situation where I could work and show how great of a artist I can be,” Fat Trel explained. “And I felt like that situation wasn’t providing me with that. And then when I left, I seen he had did an interview with like, The Breakfast Club or something.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“It was him and Alley Boy and they was like, ‘Yo where Fat Trel at?’ And Master P said something like, ‘Fat Trel, man, he didn’t have any patience. He didn’t believe in what I had going on and he was just trying to get a deal. Fat Trel just tryna sign a deal so he could get some money.’ I looked at that like that was a form of disrespect.”</p><p>Trel went on to explain that he never bothered to talk to Master P about it all after that because he didn’t have any respect for him.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I ain’t call his phone or nothing,” Trel said. “I ain’t have no conversation with him or nothing because I been around P and I know what type of person he really is and if I respected him as a man, I would have felt some type of way about it. But being around him and knowing what type of n-gga he is, I just let it slide like fuck that shit. It ain’t that serious and even though he lying – he lied to their faces –&nbsp;because there was never supposed to be a Louie V Mob. We was never supposed to record a single record together. That was not in the plans.”</p><p>Fat Trel would go on to sign to Rick Ross’ Maybach Music Group in 2013 – which <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Master P later said was a better fit</a> for him than No Limit anyway, echoing similar sentiments from his Breakfast Club interview.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Fat Trel is a good rap artist, but the No Limit Forever brand is about building entrepreneurs and business partners,” P said in a 2014 interview. “When I was around Fat Trel, he was in a rush to getting a check and a record deal versus being patient and building his own to be a true boss. I even spoke with his manager and told him that this was not an overnight process.”</p><p>He also spoke about his initial relationship with Gleesh and said he treated him as a member of his movement even without officially signing him.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/11/fat-trel-released-from-prison--250x142.png alt="Fat Trel Released From Prison & Promises To Stay Out" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Fat Trel Released From Prison & Promises To Stay Out</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>November 22, 2022</p></a><p>“I went above and beyond for Fat Trel,” P explained. “I took him out a negative environment, got him a safe place to stay in Los Angeles, transportation, put money in his pocket, paid for plane tickets and hotels for him and his team, got him exposure, put him on music with me and all without a contract just because I believed in the little homie.</p><p>“I told his mother that I would do my best to help him,” he continued. “I admit I was surprised when I heard that he did a deal with Wale because I thought they didn’t like each other. But I wish him the best with MMG. I think it’s a better fit for him as an artist.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Trel was released from prison in November, following multiple years of being in and out of the system – which undoubtedly derailed his career. Upon his latest release, however, he promised to stay out of the prison system and keep giving his fans new music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0midmqxdqb%2BmuIymmKyslad6sXnFmqOlp6Wpeq6xzZqanmWZnnq0u8KinK2xXaiyssHEpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffat-trel-master-p-fell-out-after-failed-menace-ii-society-sequel.html&text=Fat%20Trel%20%26amp%3b%20Master%20P%20Fell%20Out%20After%20Failed%20Menace%20II%20Society%20Sequel&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffat-trel-master-p-fell-out-after-failed-menace-ii-society-sequel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffat-trel-master-p-fell-out-after-failed-menace-ii-society-sequel.html&title=Fat%20Trel%20%26amp%3b%20Master%20P%20Fell%20Out%20After%20Failed%20Menace%20II%20Society%20Sequel" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffat-trel-master-p-fell-out-after-failed-menace-ii-society-sequel.html&title=Fat%20Trel%20%26amp%3b%20Master%20P%20Fell%20Out%20After%20Failed%20Menace%20II%20Society%20Sequel" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffat-trel-master-p-fell-out-after-failed-menace-ii-society-sequel.html&title=Fat%20Trel%20%26amp%3b%20Master%20P%20Fell%20Out%20After%20Failed%20Menace%20II%20Society%20Sequel" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffat-trel-master-p-fell-out-after-failed-menace-ii-society-sequel.html&description=Fat%20Trel%20%26amp%3b%20Master%20P%20Fell%20Out%20After%20Failed%20Menace%20II%20Society%20Sequel" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./stephan-petersen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stephan Petersen">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dating-status-family-net-worth-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dating Status, Family, Net Worth, and More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
