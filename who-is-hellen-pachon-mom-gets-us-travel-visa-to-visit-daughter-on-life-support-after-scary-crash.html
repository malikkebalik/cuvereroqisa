In the early hours of January 26 in Deerfield Beach, Hellen Pachon was using a motorized scooter when she was struck by a pickup truck near Northeast 3rd Avenue and 48th Street.</p><p>Paola Andrea Duran, her mother, said the 21-year-old has <a href=#>life-threatening injuries</a> to her head and lungs, as well as two fractured legs and three broken ribs. Due to the injuries, doctors at Broward Health North have determined that Pachon's left <a href=#>leg must be amputated</a>, as reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Independent.</a></p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Woman divorces husband after unearthing his 'sick, twisted' online fantasy involving her sister and children</a></p><p><a href=#>Tragic death of JJ Hammond: Mom Jennifer Keim gets 4-year probation after disabled son, 15, dies</a></p><h2 class=split><strong>Who is Hellen Pachon?</strong></h2><p>For about a year, Hellen Pachon had been living in the US and working to support her two brothers as well as Duran, who still resided in Colombia.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the authorities, Pachon was on a scooter when she crashed into a car near Deerfield Beach. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Telemundo 51</a> reports that the driver remained on the scene. It is unclear if charges will be brought in this instance.</p><h2 class=split>What did Paola Andrea Duran say?</h2><p>Duran begged the US Embassy in Colombia on social media for days to step in and let her see her daughter. Following her arrival in the US last week, Duran was finally able to visit her daughter, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NBC 6.</a></p><p>Pachon's severe brain injury worried medical professionals at Broward Health North the most. Duran claimed that the medical professionals had told her that since her daughter was still receiving life support, there was nothing more they could do to help her. "She's always been a fighter," Duran said through tears to the site in Spanish. “I know she can recover from this.”</p><p>Doctors have warned Duran that her daughter's prognosis is poor and that she would almost certainly have to make the decision to remove Pachon from life support. “I just called the hospital and they told me that the injuries on her left leg are too severe, they’ll have to amputate,” Duran told Telemundo last week. Duran will be permitted to stay in the United States for three months.</p><p>"Every driver of a vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian or any person propelling a human-powered vehicle and give warning when necessary and exercise proper precaution upon observing any child or any obviously confused or incapacitated person," according to Florida Vehicle Code 316.130. When a driver fails to slow down in order to prevent colliding with a scooter rider, there may be grounds for a negligence claim.</p><p>Commercial pickup trucks are frequently employed. If a pickup truck driver was at work at the time of the accident, their employer could be held liable. Companies are generally accountable for the improper actions of their workers while performing their employment tasks. A pickup truck driver, for example, could have been delivering building supplies when they crashed. Victims of scooter accidents frequently sustain severe and costly injuries, such as bone fractures, injuries to the head, and lacerations.</p><p>When it comes to car accidents, Florida is a no-fault state. Any person who is catastrophically harmed as a result of a driver's careless behavior, on the other hand, may be entitled to seek some form of justice through a civil claim. A legal claim for damages can assist pay many of the costs associated with a major accident. A scooter accident lawyer can look over all of the details of your case and advise you on your legal choices, as reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Torklaw.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKGcpaSVo3qxrcKhpqdlnaS6brPErapmraNiwbOt1Z6jZq6ZqK5uwM5mraKrmal6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJivK95y6KdnmWjqr2xu9GtZJqepJq%2Fbr%2FCmqmyZZOnrrS0</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-hellen-pachon-mom-gets-us-travel-visa-to-visit-daughter-on-life-support-after-scary-crash.html&text=Who%20is%20Hellen%20Pachon%3f%20Mom%20gets%20US%20travel%20visa%20to%20visit%20daughter%20on%20life%20support%20after%20scary%20crash&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-hellen-pachon-mom-gets-us-travel-visa-to-visit-daughter-on-life-support-after-scary-crash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hellen-pachon-mom-gets-us-travel-visa-to-visit-daughter-on-life-support-after-scary-crash.html&title=Who%20is%20Hellen%20Pachon%3f%20Mom%20gets%20US%20travel%20visa%20to%20visit%20daughter%20on%20life%20support%20after%20scary%20crash" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-hellen-pachon-mom-gets-us-travel-visa-to-visit-daughter-on-life-support-after-scary-crash.html&title=Who%20is%20Hellen%20Pachon%3f%20Mom%20gets%20US%20travel%20visa%20to%20visit%20daughter%20on%20life%20support%20after%20scary%20crash" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hellen-pachon-mom-gets-us-travel-visa-to-visit-daughter-on-life-support-after-scary-crash.html&title=Who%20is%20Hellen%20Pachon%3f%20Mom%20gets%20US%20travel%20visa%20to%20visit%20daughter%20on%20life%20support%20after%20scary%20crash" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-hellen-pachon-mom-gets-us-travel-visa-to-visit-daughter-on-life-support-after-scary-crash.html&description=Who%20is%20Hellen%20Pachon%3f%20Mom%20gets%20US%20travel%20visa%20to%20visit%20daughter%20on%20life%20support%20after%20scary%20crash" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shocked-louisville-officer-mark-kordis-obituary-louisville-officer-mark-kordis-died-while-of.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="[Shocked]  Louisville Officer Mark Kordis Obituary, Louisville Officer Mark Kordis Died While Of">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./photos-of-hannah-brown-more-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos Of Hannah Brown &amp;amp; More  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
