Additionally, he became well-known after making an appearance on the racing reality TV program “Street Outlaws: New Orleans.” Additionally, Kelley broke the previous record when he defeated 14-time world champion racer Mike Murillo.</strong></p><h2><span id=His_Wealth>His Wealth</span></h2><p>Kye has amassed substantial wealth as a racer with multiple victories. His income is also increased by his employment on the popular Discovery program “Street Outlaws.” In actuality, Kelley’s anticipated 2022 net worth is $1 million.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_the_Age_of_Kye_Kelley_His_siblings_and_parents>What Is the Age of Kye Kelley? His siblings and parents</span></h2><p>On May 18, 1985, in Magnolia, Mississippi, USA, Kye Kelley was born to parents Tammy Kelley and Kyle Kelley I. The drag racer will be 37 years old in 2022. Lacey Howell is the younger sister of Kye. In 2017, after completing her studies at Southwest Mississippi Community College, Lacey became engaged to Jay Howell.</p><p>In addition to wishing his sister well on her college graduation, Kelley left a brief note for his family on April 27, 2017. The text in the caption says,</p><p>I just wanted to say congrats to my baby sister for finishing college, taking care of her husband Jay and me full time, and finding an old boy I like rather well. I always said no one could ever be good enough for her. I’ve witnessed instances where a baby refused to go to sleep, stayed up all night, and attended class!</p><p>According to accounts, the drag racer was raised primarily by his mother and sister; his father did not accompany them. He was a drug and alcohol addict. Kye once claimed that his mother guided them toward achievement even though they were no longer with their father. In addition, Kye is a citizen of the United States and is of the white ethnicity.</p><h2><span id=Instruction>Instruction</span></h2><p>Kye Kelley attended Magnolia, Mississippi’s South Pike Senior High School. With a 3.83 GPA, he graduated from high school and received a partial scholarship for his college education.</p><p>But after that, he never went back to school since he couldn’t afford the tuition.</p><h2><span id=Kye_Kelley_began_his_career_in_auto_racing_at_the_age_of_fifteen>Kye Kelley began his career in auto racing at the age of fifteen.</span></h2><p>As previously said, after high school, he stopped going to school. Kye Kelley then started working to support his family financially. When he was thirteen, he worked odd jobs like bagging groceries and milking cows for Wayne Jacobsen. His primary goals were to become a race car driver and save money.</p><p>With the money he had been saving, he went to Boyd and bought his first automobile when he turned fifteen. But he couldn’t become one without a license. He started doing odd jobs once more. Kelley then started working for an oil refinery company.</p><p>In just 13 years, he rose from clerk to superintendent and was among the company’s youngest managers ever. But his dream remained unfulfilled. Despite owning multiple race cars, including Shocker, Kyle was still a superintendent and not a motorsports athlete.</p><h2><span id=He_Began_Street_Racing_as_His_Career_as_an_Automobile_Racer>He Began Street Racing as His Career as an Automobile Racer.</span></h2><p>Kye Kelley started street racing with his friends in the area while he was still employed at oil refineries. He briefly dabbled in dirt bike racing before transitioning into the car racing industry. Later, Kye also engaged in a lot of grudge racing. They used to wager money and engage in rivalry. “It was just a fun thing to do,” Kye once remarked.</p><p>We can see where Kye is and what he has accomplished in the racing scene after years of hard work. In summary, he is currently a cast member of several shows on the Discovery Channel, including America’s List, No Prep Kings, and Street Outlaws New Orleans.</p><p>Furthermore, he has established the Kye Kelley Racing YouTube channel, which currently has over 80,000 subscribers. There, he primarily posts footage of racing automobiles and outdoor and hunting-related items.</p><h2><span id=The_marriage_between_Alisa_Mote_and_Kye_Kelley_didn8217t_last_long>The marriage between Alisa Mote and Kye Kelley didn’t last long.</span></h2><p>Alisa Mote, the ex-wife of Kye Kelley, is a nurse whom he initially encountered in the late 2000s. They later became romantically involved and shared a few years of a relationship. According to accounts, in March 2014, Kye became engaged to his ex-wife Alisa.</p><p>2015 was the year that Kye and Alisa formally exchanged vows. In a similar vein, their family and close friends attended their intimate wedding.</p><p>The ex-couple spent a few years together as a married pair. But Kye and his ex-wife Alisa declared their separation in 2017. Nevertheless, the reasons for their separation have not yet been disclosed by either party.</p><p>Rumors seem to suggest that the driver of the car was seeing Lizzy Musi, another driver, romantically.</p><h2><span id=Kelley_and_his_wife_have_a_child_together>Kelley and his wife have a child together.</span></h2><p>With his ex-wife Alisa, the drag racer has a daughter named Kenadeigh Alexa Kelley. In March of 2016, they welcomed their daughter. Additionally, Kye created a Facebook post on March 24, 2016, with the following caption:</p><p>Now, here she is!!!!!! 19-3/4′′ and 7lbs even, Kenadeigh Alexa Kelley.</p><h2><span id=After_the_birth_of_their_daughter_Kye_Kelley_and_his_ex-wife_Alisa_Mote_already_had_a_divorce>After the birth of their daughter, Kye Kelley and his ex-wife Alisa Mote already had a divorce.</span></h2><p>The ex-couples are currently co-parenting their daughter following their divorce. Kye occasionally highlights his daughter on Instagram. It is safe to conclude that their daughter’s life has not been impacted by their divorce.</p><h2><span id=When_AD_Kelly_began_dating_drag_racer_Lizzy_Musi_did_he_become_engaged_to_her>When AD Kelly began dating drag racer Lizzy Musi, did he become engaged to her?</span></h2><p>Kye began dating drag racer Lizzy Musi shortly after he and his wife Alisa got divorced. The pair got together at a racetrack, where Kye was a competitor and close friend of Lizzy’s dad, Pat Musi. It was also her father who first introduced them.</p><p>2021 saw the engagement of Kye Kelley and his now-fiance Lizzy. Kye with his girlfriend-turned-fiance Lizzy</p><p>In reality, it didn’t take them long to become friends, and then-boyfriend and girlfriend, as they both had a passion for auto racing.</p><p>Following more than a year of dating, Kye decided to pop the question to Lizzy—but only if he triumphed in a no-prep kings event. The racer failed to win, but Kelley won his heart and asked his longtime love Lizzy to marry him. Key frothed and exclaimed, “I’m winning, right?”</p><p>Even after losing the event, he displayed his satisfaction and was overtaken by his lover.</p><p>“I’m the best in my book even though tonight wasn’t my big win and she said yes.”</p><p>They haven’t tied the knot, though. We anticipate that they will eventually make a public announcement about their wedding plans.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Erica Lindbeck, Johnny Fratto, and Jaye Sousoures."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":40}{"1":46,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":60}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/erica-lindbeck/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/johnny-fratto/"}{"1":40}{"1":46,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jaye-sousoures/"}{"1":60}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Erica Lindbeck</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Johnny Fratto</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jaye Sousoures</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>drag racers</a> <a href=# rel=tag>TV personality</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Trisha Tubu | Gender And Sexuality</a></h3>Trisha Tubu is a Filipino volleyball player who competed for the Adamson Lady Falcons in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) women's volleyball competition as a rookie spiker <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Chandler Halderson Siblings | Family Ethnicity And Religion</a></h3>People are curious to learn more about the case and look for the siblings of Chandler Halderson.
