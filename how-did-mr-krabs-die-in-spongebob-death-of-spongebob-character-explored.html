As kids, we all watched SpongeBob and his friends in Bikini Bottom go on many different adventures.</p><p>A shocking piece of news was shared on the show, which was a big deal and shocked everyone. The people who make the show say that one of the characters, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mr. Krabs</a>, has died. In the Krusty Krab restaurant, Mr. Krabs was found dead, according to the news.</p><p>Here are the facts about how Mr. Krabs died and what happened after that.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who Is Mr. Krabs?</strong></h2><p>Eugene Harold Krabs, also known as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mr. Krabs</a>, is a character on Nickelodeon’s popular show SpongeBob SquarePants. He owns the Krusty Krab, a restaurant that is known all over the world. It is best known for its Krabby Patty burgers, which look delicious.</p><p>It is known for having the main character, SpongeBob, work as a burger flipper at a burger joint where the manager is obsessed with making money. He is also the father of a whale named Pearl, whom he loves more than anything.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Mr.Krabs Die?</h2><p>In the document called “The Trial of SpongeBob SquarePants,” Mr. Krabs is found dead in his restaurant. He also has his throat cut. The wound was caused by the metal spatula, the coroner said, and another one was found next to his body. The spatula was all covered in his blood.</p><p>On the back of his head, there were signs of a blow to the head. On top of that, the Krusty Krab floor was slippery. It had cooking grease all over it. There were also footprints in the grease, including the main characters. But there were no signs of him in the pool of Mr. Krab’s blood.</p><p>There were no signs of a break-in, but the cash register at the Krusty Krab was empty. On the other hand, his safe was found to be open, and the secret recipe for the Krabby Patty was also missing.</p><p>Mr. Krabs’ claw was hurt, but it was starting to get better. It means that the cut or wound wasn’t caused by this murder, but instead happened a few weeks before this happened.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Killed Mr. Krabs?</h2><p>There have been many claims about who killed Mr. Krabs and left him in such a terrible state. In one of the sentences, it says that SpongeBob killed Mr. Krabs. But this claim can’t be taken at face value.</p><p>Plankton, who is also in the show, has his own restaurant called Chum Bucket. Some theories say that Plankton is the one who killed Mr. Krabs. As the investigation went on, it turned out that SpongeBob worked for Mr. Krabs, and even though the sponge had worked at the restaurant for a long time, Mr. Krabs had never fired him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is There Proof Of The Murderer?</h2><p>Mr. Krab’s blood and fingerprints were on the spatula that was used to kill the crab. But what’s more surprising about the situation is that SpongeBob’s fingerprints were on this spatula, making it impossible for him not to be guilty.</p><p>After Krabs was killed, it took Plankton a long time to start selling recipes like the ones Mr. Krabs used to sell. SpongeBob’s loan was also paid back, and he said it was because he was kind. All of these things suggest that they are working together to kill Krabs.</p><p>A few people said that they saw SpongeBob go into the restaurant two hours before Mr. Krabs’ body was found. Patrick said in a statement that SpongeBob went to the restaurant to see Mr. Krabs. He saw that Krabs was sad and heard him say that he might never sell another burger again.</p><p>So far, nothing concrete has been found out about why Mr. Krabs was killed, and more research needs to be done.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mr. Krabs Is A Lot Older Than You Think!</h2><p>When you look at SpongeBob, you might not be able to tell how old he is. But did you know that a picture of his hard-earned license was used on the show to show how old he is?</p><p>The picture on a piece of paper shows that SpongeBob was born on July 14, 1986. Mr. Krabs, his boss, was born on November 30, 1942, which makes him almost 75 years old. But Mr. Krabs was seen running a restaurant like a boss even though he was old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvHqK5mnJmZeq6%2BjKSpmpqjYrGqsYyipWaroKS7qLHBqJlo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-mr-krabs-die-in-spongebob-death-of-spongebob-character-explored.html&text=How%20Did%20Mr.%20Krabs%20Die%20In%20Spongebob%3f%20Death%20Of%20Spongebob%20Character%20Explored&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-mr-krabs-die-in-spongebob-death-of-spongebob-character-explored.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-mr-krabs-die-in-spongebob-death-of-spongebob-character-explored.html&title=How%20Did%20Mr.%20Krabs%20Die%20In%20Spongebob%3f%20Death%20Of%20Spongebob%20Character%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-did-mr-krabs-die-in-spongebob-death-of-spongebob-character-explored.html&title=How%20Did%20Mr.%20Krabs%20Die%20In%20Spongebob%3f%20Death%20Of%20Spongebob%20Character%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-mr-krabs-die-in-spongebob-death-of-spongebob-character-explored.html&title=How%20Did%20Mr.%20Krabs%20Die%20In%20Spongebob%3f%20Death%20Of%20Spongebob%20Character%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-mr-krabs-die-in-spongebob-death-of-spongebob-character-explored.html&description=How%20Did%20Mr.%20Krabs%20Die%20In%20Spongebob%3f%20Death%20Of%20Spongebob%20Character%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-dr-tony-evans-engaged-who-is-he-engaged-to-who-is-his-fiance-dr-carla-crummie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Dr Tony Evans Engaged?
