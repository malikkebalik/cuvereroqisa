However, she is also an artist signed with Def Jam Recordings, and is recognized for songs such as ‘’Scars To Your Beautiful’’ and ‘’Here’’.</p><p>So just how rich is Alessia Cara as of late 2017? According to authoritative sources, this Canadian singer has the net worth of $4 million, accumulated from her career in the previously mentioned field over just a few short years.</p><h3>Alessia Cara Net Worth $4 million</h3><p>When it comes to her education, Alessia attended Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School. She was oriented towards art from an early age and wrote poetry, and was included in theatre productions. She has been playing guitar since she was only 10 years old, and only three years later, she joined the social media website, YouTube, and began uploading her music covers. Using the previously mentioned website, she was able to get her work out there, which certainly played a significant role in her career and helped her gain attention, which ultimately resulted in Cara being signed by Def Jam Recordings. In addition to that, she has made notable radio appearances, and collaborated with EP Entertainment imprint. 2015 was the year she stepped up and took her career further, releasing her debut single entitled ‘’ Here’’, produced by Pop & Oak and Sebastian Kole, and described as ‘’a song for everyone who secretly hates parties’’ by MTV, based on Alessia’s personal experience, and realization that she hates parties. Besides being noticed by MTV, ‘’Here’’ also had several other prominent mentions, being listed as a ‘’must hear song’’ by Cosmopolitan magazine. Her net worth benefited accordingly.</p><p>On 29 July of the same year, Cara had her first television appearance as a part of “Here’s” promotion, on ‘’The Tonight Show Starring <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a>’’. In the forthcoming period, ‘’Here’’ was nominated for the Streamy Award in the Original Song category. Then, Cara released her debut EP ‘’Four Pink Walls’’, which consisted of five songs, including ‘’Here’’. This was followed by the release of her first album, ‘’Know-it-all’’, in November of the same year, thus it is safe to say that Alessia remained busy throughout that period. Her efforts were recognized as she was on the BBC’s list of ‘’ Music Sound of…’’ award, and finished as a runner-up in 2016 in addition to receiving an award for the Breakthrough Artist of the Year at the 2016 Juno Awards.</p><p>In March 2016, she released the official video for ‘’Wild Things’’ and was announced as one of the supporting artists for Coldplay’s European tour. In June 2016, she performed at the Glastonbury Festival, and shortly after that, the music video for ‘’How Far I’ll Go’’, featured in Disney’s film ‘’Moana’’ was released. In the same manner, she made another video, for her song ‘’Seventeen’’, at the end of 2016, all adding to her net worth.</p><p>When it comes to her latest projects, Alessia was a music guest on ‘’Saturday Night Live’’ in February 2017 and in less than 20 days, a lyric video for her song ‘’Stay’’ was released. She also collaborated with Logic, working on the song entitled ‘’ 1-800-273-8255’’. Overall, despite being on the music scene for a short period of time, Alessia has bwen able to secure her own place, and work on prominent projects as described.</p><p>When it comes to Cara’s private life, she hasn’t been open about her previous relationships, although she mentioned having been in one. As of today, she is dating <a href=#>Beyonce’s</a> songwriter, Kevin Garrett. Alessia is active on social media websites such as Instagram, where she has an army of more than 1.4 million followers.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=16.460891089109><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Alessia Cara</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 11, 1996</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Brampton, Ontario, Canada</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.57 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Songwrite</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/alessiacara</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/alessiacara</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36734693877551><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/alessiasmusic/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7487200/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.24615384615385><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/alessia-cara-mn0003396562</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Awards</td><td>Juno Award for Breakthrough Artist of the Year, MuchMusic Video Award for Best New Canadian Artist, Centre Hall, PA, United States, Scars to Your Beautiful, Here, How Far I'll Go</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Albums</td><td>Know-It-All, Four Pink Walls</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Nominations</td><td>American Music Award for New Artist of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video, MTV Europe Music Award for Best Push Artist, BET Award for Best New Artist, Juno Award for Artist of the Year, Juno Fan Choice Award, Juno Award for Single of the Year, iHeartRadio Music Award for Best Cover S...</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The JUNO Awards 2016</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=7><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>C4's Future Sounds</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series performer -
