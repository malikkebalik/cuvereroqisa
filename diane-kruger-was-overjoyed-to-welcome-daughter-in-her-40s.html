Having started her journey in Hollywood alongside Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom in Troy in 2004, she worked on many other fantastic projects. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This fame and connection in the industry also took her places. She enjoyed her life to the fullest she could even before turning 40.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"I have been to every party, I have been to every country that I wanted to visit," Kruger told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Telegraph</a> in January 2022. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And it was exactly this experience and having had the fill for it that made her realize she was ready for motherhood.</p><p>She had, in a way, given up on becoming a mother.&nbsp;But when she first realized she was about to have a baby, she was happily taken aback.</p><p>"She was definitely a surprise. I sort of had given up on the idea of that happening," she admitted while talking about her daughter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Kruger and her fiance, <a href=# rel=follow>Norman Reedus</a>, had their daughter in November 2018. <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Kruger was 42</a> when she had her.</p><p>Even though it was a case of luck striking late, she does not wish for things to have happened differently.</p><h2>Diane Kruger Glad to Have Had Her Daughter after 40</h2><p>When asked if she wished she started a family a decade earlier, Kruger did not want that. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I'm so glad I did not have a kid at 30," the actress told the publication. "I think I would have absolutely resented it."</p><p>The reason?</p><p><img alt="Diane Kruger with her daughter, whose face she is yet to reveal." height=661 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Diane-Kruger-daughter.jpg width=750 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Diane Kruger with her daughter, whose face she is yet to reveal.</strong> (Photo: Diane Kruger/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She did not want to give up all the&nbsp;things mentioned above&nbsp;at that age. At the time of the interview, however, Kruger was ready to make those&nbsp;sacrifices for her daughter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"I'm 100 per cent ready and willing to give my kid that attention. But at 30, I know I would not have been ready to do this properly," she confessed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Between her and Reedus, he is the one with more experience with children. The Walking Dead actor has a son, Mingus, from his previous relationship with Danish supermodel Helena Christensen. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Mingus was already 16 when Kruger entered Reedus' life. So, she never developed a step-mother-step-son relationship with Mingus.</p><p>"I'm not his stepmom… we're friends," said the actress of her relationship with Mingus. And having known Christensen for longer than Reedus, she has a good relationship with her, too.</p><p>The three are now a part of a joint family. She even talked about how they were going to spend the 2022 Christmas together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her daughter is now three, and the actress is already teaching her the ways of life in Hollywood.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Kruger said she was "trying to take the idea of a home base out of her head." The little one has also started with Montessori and is helping Kruger bond with her mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyZlrumecqrrKCdomKxosHGoaueql6dwa64</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdiane-kruger-was-overjoyed-to-welcome-daughter-in-her-40s.html&text=Diane%20Kruger%20Was%20Overjoyed%20to%20Welcome%20Daughter%20in%20Her%2040s&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdiane-kruger-was-overjoyed-to-welcome-daughter-in-her-40s.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdiane-kruger-was-overjoyed-to-welcome-daughter-in-her-40s.html&title=Diane%20Kruger%20Was%20Overjoyed%20to%20Welcome%20Daughter%20in%20Her%2040s" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdiane-kruger-was-overjoyed-to-welcome-daughter-in-her-40s.html&title=Diane%20Kruger%20Was%20Overjoyed%20to%20Welcome%20Daughter%20in%20Her%2040s" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdiane-kruger-was-overjoyed-to-welcome-daughter-in-her-40s.html&title=Diane%20Kruger%20Was%20Overjoyed%20to%20Welcome%20Daughter%20in%20Her%2040s" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdiane-kruger-was-overjoyed-to-welcome-daughter-in-her-40s.html&description=Diane%20Kruger%20Was%20Overjoyed%20to%20Welcome%20Daughter%20in%20Her%2040s" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hayden-stanley-meatball-obituary-gilmer-tx-former-camp-wow-staff-died-in-motorcycle-acci.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hayden Stanley Meatball Obituary, Gilmer TX, former Camp WOW Staff died in motorcycle acci">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./all-you-need-to-know-about-aleksander-emelianenko.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All You Need To Know About Aleksander Emelianenko">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
