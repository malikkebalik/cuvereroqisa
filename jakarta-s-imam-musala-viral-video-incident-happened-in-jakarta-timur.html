The video, which was uploaded on the Instagram account @kabarjaktim on Saturday (16/12/2023), shows a man wearing a green shirt being apprehended by locals after being suspected of planning a stabbing attack. Despite being captured, the man remained silent and did not resist. The incident took place at Musala Baitul Huda on Batu Ampar I Street, RT 17/RW 02, Batu Ampar Village, Kramat Jati District, Jakarta Timur, on Friday (15/12/2023) at around 7:40 PM.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Incident_Details></span>Incident Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The mosque’s imam, Lazuardy Firdaus, revealed that he was almost stabbed by a man identified as MMA (26) after leading the congregational Isya prayer. “As I was leaving the mosque to start my motorcycle, the perpetrator suddenly approached me and asked, ‘Are you the imam?’ I replied, ‘Yes,'” Lazuardy said in an interview in Jakarta Timur on Saturday (16/12/2023), as quoted from TribunJakarta.com. MMA, who had only been renting in the Batu Ampar area for about a month, then took out a kitchen knife from his pants pocket and attempted to stab the imam. Fortunately, Lazuardy managed to dodge the attack and subdue MMA. “I only sustained minor injuries, nothing serious. I managed to evade the attack and fell off my motorcycle. I shouted for help, and the locals immediately came to my aid. They apprehended the perpetrator here at the mosque,” Lazuardy explained.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Imams_Account_of_the_Incident></span>Imam’s Account of the Incident<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/asset-2.tstatic.net/tribunnews/foto/bank/images/imam-musala-di-jakarta-timur-nyaris-jadi-korban-penusukan-seorang-pria.jpg alt="Viral Video Imam Musala di Jakarta Timur Jadi Korban Penusukan, Sempat Mengelak hingga Jatuh - TribunNews.com" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>According to Lazuardy, the perpetrator claimed that he was disturbed by the sound of the mosque’s speaker. However, Lazuardy emphasized that the incident was unexpected and unprovoked. He expressed gratitude for escaping the attack with minor injuries and praised the swift response of the locals in apprehending the perpetrator. Lazuardy’s account of the incident highlights the importance of maintaining a safe and peaceful environment within religious institutions.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Arrest_and_Investigation></span>Arrest and Investigation<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Following the incident, MMA was taken into custody by the Bhabinkamtibmas personnel of Batu Ampar Village and brought to the Kramat Jati Police Station for further investigation. Kramat Jati Police Chief, Kompol Rusit Malaka, stated that during preliminary questioning, MMA admitted to carrying out the attack due to being disturbed by the mosque’s speaker. He explained that MMA lived in close proximity to the mosque and decided to take a kitchen knife with him to confront the imam. MMA is now being held at the Kramat Jati Police Station as a suspect and is charged under Article 335 of the Indonesian Penal Code, which pertains to the use of force. Additionally, he is also charged under Article 2 of Emergency Law No. 12 of 1951 regarding the possession of sharp weapons, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. The investigation is ongoing, with the involvement of witnesses and the attention of the Kapolres (Chief of Police).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Motivation_Behind_the_Attack></span>Motivation Behind the Attack<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The attempted stabbing of the mosque imam in Jakarta Timur has left many wondering about the motivation behind the attack. While the incident was shocking and unexpected, it is important to understand the factors that led the perpetrator, MMA, to resort to such violence. Investigations have revealed that MMA claimed to be disturbed by the sound of the mosque’s speaker, which ultimately triggered his aggressive response. However, it is crucial to note that this incident does not reflect the beliefs or actions of the wider community, as it was an isolated act carried out by an individual.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Disruption_from_Mosque_Speaker></span>Disruption from Mosque Speaker<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/asset-2.tstatic.net/tribunnews/foto/bank/images2/kapolda-metro-jaya-usai-salat-jumat.jpg alt="Viral Video Imam Musala di Jakarta Timur Jadi Korban Penusukan, Sempat Mengelak hingga Jatuh - TribunNews.com" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The disruption caused by the mosque’s speaker played a significant role in the events that unfolded on that fateful day. MMA, who resided in close proximity to the mosque, expressed his frustration with the noise emanating from the speaker. While it is understandable that excessive noise can be bothersome, it is essential to address such concerns through peaceful means and open dialogue. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a harmonious environment within religious institutions, where the needs and comfort of all worshippers are taken into consideration.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Legal_Consequences_for_the_Attacker></span>Legal Consequences for the Attacker<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The attacker, MMA, now faces severe legal consequences for his actions. He has been charged under Article 335 of the Indonesian Penal Code, which deals with the use of force. This charge reflects the seriousness of the offense and the potential harm that could have been inflicted on the imam. Additionally, MMA is also charged under Article 2 of Emergency Law No. 12 of 1951, which pertains to the possession of sharp weapons. These charges carry significant penalties, including a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. The legal process will ensure that justice is served and that incidents like these are not tolerated within society.</p><p>A video of a man allegedly attempting to harm an imam at a mosque in East Jakarta has gone viral on social media.
